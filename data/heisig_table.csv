一,"One down, 2041 to go. ;).","This one is too difficult to remember. If the other Kanji are this difficult, I'm giving up.","One Line to Rule Them All, One Way to Write it; One Stroke From Left to Right, and With a Pen Lift, Bind it."
二,Two lines.,"No wonder the hotel room only cost TWO yen, all it had was a ceiling and a floor.","I have TWO Itchy knees 一 (Ichi), 二 (Ni)."
三,One + two = three.,"THREE measurements define the female shape: BUST, WAIST, and HIPS. Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.","One (一) on top of two (二), gives three (三)."
四,FOUR year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.,"I imagine a giant devouring a human in four bites. First the giant bites off the person's head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the fourth bite falling in there?","This is a picture of a slab in the morgue. It is pulled out from the drawer, and it is showing only the dead person's feet. Clearly shi means DEATH."
五,三 + two vertical lines = 5.,"Five - has a THREE, and a small 'h'... 'high five'.",三 + II= 5.
六,"Indicating 6 parts of the human body: head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs.","The Devil, always a gentleman, wears a top hat, but his goat legs, betray the Beast. 666 is his number.",A top hat with animal legs is clearly the work of the devil. Six six six!
七,"This kanji is our good old seven, turned upside down.",I wrote it upside down so I crossed it out.,"My NANA can't do exercise number 7, so SHICHI-ts."
八,"""Hachi"" (eight) begins with the sound of the katakana ""ha"", and it's approximately the same character.",The valcano hasn't erupted for 8 years.,The curtains close at eight.

口,Looks like a huge open mouth.,"When you sneeze, your MOUTH forms a square, and you make a noise that sounds like (KUCHI).",（つ゜口゜）つ（Insert something yummy here).
日,"Open the window, new day.","=sun; day： Each time the SUN rises a new DAY begins. 日 (#12) is a picture of the sun. Normally we draw the sun with a circle(ㅇ) surrounded by many strokes. But there are no “round” shaped Kanji so we take 口 (#11) instead, and one stroke in the middle (one (#1)) representing all. 日本　Japan,　日曜日（ニチジヨウび）Sunday,　毎日（マイニチ）everyday, 母の日（ははのひ）mother's day,　日記（ニッキ）diary,　三日（ミッカ）three days.",Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: Day & Night.
月,A month is longer than a day.,"Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air ""mooning"" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of month, considering that months were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning ""ass"" part of it connects well to Hesig's seemingly unconnected ""flesh"" or ""part of the body"" meaning (when used in primitive form).","Month - every MOON cycle, werewolves eat FLESH, and other PARTs OF THE BODY."
田,A rice field divided into four parts.,Ten rice fields can feed many mouths.,Ten people use their mouths to eat the yield of the rice fields.
目,目_目.,There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your eye. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color.,Look at those tears in eyes. You moku me cry! .·目_目·.
古,Tombstone and cross on an old man's grave.,You get OLD fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.,Old people tend to talk a lot. Almost as if they had TEN MOUTHS!
吾,I have 5 senses.,I eat five times at day.,"I consist of five senses to observe, one mouth to speak. For order, remember that observing through the senses should be done before using one's mouth."
冒,"Don't look at the sun directly with your eyes, it's risky!",You'll risk your eyesight if you look up at the sun.,"Looking up at the big sun is a risk to your eye. To remember that the sun primitive is bigger than the eye primitive, imagine making your eyes little (squinting) when you go out in the bright sun to reduce the risk of getting sun blindness. READING: imagine a kid saying ""oh that's ぼう (bull as in B.S.), looking at the sun is no risk!"" [he's blind now]."
朋,My companion and I are like two moons side by side.,One moon is lonely. Two moons are companions.,Companion = flesh of my flesh.
明,The sun makes the moon bright.,"The sun and the moon are brightest objects in the day and night, respectively.","In the long run, the REAL trouble here is distinguishing it from ""shining""/""sparkle"". Choose a story to learn how to write 明. To distinguish it, remember the Japanese word 明日 (ashita, ""tomorrow"") and think of Orphan Annie singing ""Tomorrow is a brighter day""."
唱,Someone chanting with their mouth open for two consecutive days.,The monk opened his month and chanted for two days.,Chants from our mouths are meant to reach the sun and the stars. Stars are just suns just further away so they seem smaller.
晶,A diamond sparkles as brightly as three suns.,Nothing sparkles like 3 suns!,Sparkle is a 森 (#209) of suns!
品,Three boxes of goods are devoured by the hungry mouths of waiting consumers.,Three hungry mouths waiting for the goods to come.,Boxes of goods stacked on top of the other.
呂,Spine connects head and body.,The spine goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.,The spine goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (in your ass).
昌,If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be prosperous.,"I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like 'fortune', so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from 'Star Trek' (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase 'live long and PROSPER'? If that's not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.","When you are prosperous, your gold shines as brightly as two suns."
早,"The sun up is early, well before ten.","EARLY, is when you have to start your day before 10..",An early sun-flower looks like a miniature sun perched on a needlelike stems.
旭,9am carries with it the rising sun.,Nine planets revolve around our rising sun.,The sun rises before 9am.
世,3 tens = generation.,"They SAY a generation is ten+ten+ten years, with the big first ten providing a grounding, and the next ten providing a little more grounding for the final ten. But I wish the next generation didn't always SAY ""yo!"". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo).",That swing has been in that tree for generations.
胃,The rice field is harvested once a month to get food for our stomach.,The stomach is the part of the body (月）that tells my brain (田) when to eat rice.,A field of rice could fill my stomach for over a month.
旦,A nightbreak happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).,The sun rising over the horizon is giving the night a break. -nightbreak.,"HINT: You can substitute sunrise in your stories if you don't like the rare (and ambiguous) ""nightbreak"". Note that 暁 (#1285) is already taken. Don't confuse with 旭 (#27), which is the sun itself, rather than the time of the day."
胆,The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.,"For a month（月）, I was up until nightbreak（旦） because of my gall bladder（胆）.",All the month long I have to start working at nightbreak. This really activates my gall bladder (=I get angry).
亘,The sun spans from horizon to horizon in a day.,The span of the day is the time between the sun goes up and comes down.,The sunlight spans from the floor to the ceiling.
凹,"The letter ""U"" is concavely written.",Concave has a concave shape.,"Stroke order: I took a step down into the cave. A park ranger threw down a line to me from the opposite top ridge, then waited. My friend went down to the lowest passage to look for me, then the ranger threw another line down to her."
凸,"When I get vexed, I give people the middle finger.",Convex has a convex shape.,Rude Tetris piece.
旧,Age 18 = olden times.,The old man with a walking stick kept talking of olden times all day long.,"In olden times, gentlemen used walking sticks every day."
自,"To use an eyedropper by oneself, aim from above to put a drop into the eye.","I know this, but I am an idiot and forgot.... The way I remember this is to think of the way in which Japanese people point to themselves if they are unsure of who is being spoken to. In the west, we usually say, ""me?"" and point to ourselves (pointing to the chest), but in Japan, people say, ""ore/boku/atashi?"" and point directly at their nose, the drop between their eyes. True story.",Eyedrops are applied by ONESELF.
白,A white ray is a drop of sun.,Even a small drop (') of the sun (日) would make you see nothing but white.,It's a nice DAY for a WHITE wedding.
百,100 turned sideways. sort of the same as what ashoksaraf said.,That dirty ceiling was painted WHITE a hundred times!,"The ""white year"" (99) plus one more. 100!"
中,Pocky goes in the mouth.,"""SSsshhh!! we are IN the library"", she said, expressed with a finger over her mouth.",I use chopsticks to put food in my mouth.
千,It takes many drops of ten to get to a thousand.,One T = one thousand.,1000 = 10^3 (3 strokes).
舌,A thousand mouths speak the same TONGUE.,"Thousand mouths, a thousand tongues.","When you drop because you are 古 (#16), you stick your tongue out."
升,It is a thousand or ten? I need my measuring box.,"I can fit a thousand needles into my measuring box, but only if I bend the thousand.",A measuring box is a square wooden box that was used to measure one thousand grains of rice (needles) in feudal Japan. It was supposed to be enough to feed a working man for one day.
昇,"This kanji does not mean ""get up"" or ""awake."" It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN.",In old Japan the villagers used to put their measuring box on an east facing window ledge so that the sun would rise up above it and hence would be the first thing they saw in the morning. This was to remind them to use the box to measure out their kome for asagohan and ensure their store of rice would last the whole week.,If the sun sat on the measuring box made of a thousand needles he would rise up very quickly.
丸,Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!,"Watch out for 太 (#126). Here Heisig could have added a ""t"" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund. Rotund is more specific than ""round"" which begs for confusion with 円 (#1952). A dictionary search on ""fat"" or ""round"" doesn't yield this kanji, but ""rotund"" does! Primitive suggestion: the Laughing Buddha is often depicted as a rotund, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).",Cut the tail off of a 9 and it will be round.
寸,The decimal system uses drops of ten as a measurement.,Use two lines (X axis and Y axis) to measure the dot (on the graph).,"Glue two sticks together to make the best measurement. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.)"
肘,The elbow is the flesh that glues together the upper and lower arm.,A body part that's used as a measurement in former days: the elbow.,Sometimes I get carried away and do elbow curls until the point where my forearm snaps off! When that happens I simply pull out the glue and re-attach the elbow to my flesh.
専,"After you have chosen your 10 fields of study, measure how good you are at each to find out your specialty.",10 brains glued together allows you to specialize in any specialty that you want. Imagine each brain having its own specialty.,"She's so good at her speciality, it's like ten brains glued together."
博,Ten specialties grants you the title of Dr. with a dot.,"Watch for 医 (#1829), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well ""learned"", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 (""doctor"") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as ""Dr. Who"", ""Dr. Jekyll"", even ""Dr. Dobb's"" if you're into programming.",Note: Use Ph.D. rather than Dr. to avoid confusion with doctor and to be more in line with common use of this kanji. Ten specialities grants you the title of Ph.D. with a dot.
占,Fortune-telling: using a mouth as a divining rod.,"A great number of people who do fortune-telling are ""almost old"".",To do fortune-telling put a magic wand in your mouth.
上,A magic wand standing on above the floor.,The divining rod is above the floor.,Zombies come above ground at night.
下,Roots are below the ground.,A magic wand hanging below the ceiling.,The divining rod is below the ceiling.
卓,The most eminent magician is he who learned to use his magic wand early in life.,"The world's most eminent sourcerer, Harry Potter, used his magic wand early in life.","Why is the code word for this ""eminent"" when it means ""table"" most of the time? I changed the keyword to ""table"" since that isn't used. It means ""eminent"" in two compounds: 卓越 (hiragana たくえつ) excellence, superiority, preeminence (卓越する be excellent; be outstanding; be preeminent) and 卓識 (hiragana たくしき) clearsightedness; penetration; farsightedness; excellent idea. Everywhere else it's table. Using a magic wand to do all the work, the TABLE was set up way earlier than expected."
朝,There is mist as the moon fades away in the morning.,"Morning has come ""ten"" hours ""early""!!! The ""moon"" is still in the sky!","In the morning, god picks the sun up to the sky with two needles (because it's too hot to touch by hands) to replace the moon."
嘲,"When I wake up, I am always late, so I hurry to work. With a bad case of perpetual morning breath, I am the subject of derision at my office whenever I open my mouth.","If morning breath emanates from your mouth, you are subject to derision!",Your mouth is full of derision in the morning because you're grumpy.
只,Imagine an animal with only a mouth and legs.,Only your mouth runs faster than your legs.,"Tada!... SHE is the only animal with only a mouth on legs and no body! (Kun reading tada, ON reading SHI)."
貝,"Stare at the shellfish, it looks like an eye with legs.",Eye thought I saw a shellfish legging it down the beach!,"Remove the eyes and the legs, and a shellfish tastes great!"
唄,The new generation of pop songs have no depth. They just mouth empty lyrics to get money. Not like the pop songs of my day.,Pop Song = using your MOUTH to get lots of CLAMS.,Out of the mouth comes a pop song and in rolls the money.
貞,A magic wand is needed to make a clam stand upright.,"Careful! This means upright in character, not in position. So although the magically standing shellfish is a cute image, it doesn't convey the right meaning. This character is mainly used to represent a woman's chastity, purity or fidelity, so I just associate chastity with magic oyster.","An UPRIGHT person is above (上) petty disputes, and always holds their head up (上). Since they live on principle, they are as hard or firm as a shell in their beliefs of what is right and what is wrong. They are wise, because they find the pearls of wisdom in the shells of life; 童貞 (virginity); 不貞 (unfaithful); 貞はる (harp too long on a subject); 貞淑 (chastity, virtue); 貞女 (virtuous woman); 不貞寝 (stay in bed out of spite); ."
員,An employee (member of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job!,An employee is basically a shellfish with a mouth.,"An employee is a worker. They lend their mouth (口) to spread a message & sell products; eyes (目) to watch competitors & find customers; and eight (八) hours a day. Alt., an employee is a shell (貝) in the ocean of a company; it looks up to the boss's mouth (口) for orders. 医員(doctor); 一員(member); 駅員(station attendant); 委員(committee member);会社員(company employee); 海員(sailor);楽員(band member); 期間契約社員 (fixed term contractor)."
貼,Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to affix it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true. Picture licking the back of the shell like a stamp and affixing it to the fortune.,"To prevent confusion with 附 (#1400) I changed this to ""paste (v.)"" or ""cut and paste"" because it is the character for pasting in a PC and in graphic design. Careful 糊 (#2692) Story: You pay money and the fortune teller cuts and pastes a good fortune and prints it out for you on his notebook PC. 切り貼り きりはり cut and paste, 貼る はる to stick/to paste, 貼付け はりつけ (computer file) paste.",To make cash (clams) the gypsy affixed a note / posted a bill to a billboard advertising her fortune telling services (contrast with 掲 (#726)).
見,"As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc. (the giant eyeball with legs...) Makes for easy stories later on.",Eyes and legs are all you need to see the world.,"Men's eyes open wide when they see the legs of a beautiful woman. (Alternatively, women's eyes open wide when they see the legs of a handsome guy ;) )."

Tip: This is a never used Kanji, but you are going to see it a few hundred more times in RTK as a primitive. Here's something that I figured out way too late. This is ALWAYS ALWAYS on the right hand side (RHS) of the characters it is a part of. Always.. Learn this primitive cold, and remember, always on the RHS."
頑,A stubborn person in the beginning gets something into their head and can't change their mind.,"Picture a STUBBORN schoolboy, with his arms crossed and his book still open to the BEGINNING PAGE. Despite the teacher telling him to turn the page, he refuses and keeps his book on the BEGINNING PAGE.","He's so stubborn, he won't read past the beginning page!"
凡,A drop of breeze is naught but a mediocre wind.,A drop of rain in the wind... what a mediocre rainy season...,Nothing is more mediocre than a single drop in the wind.

肌,When you expose your flesh to the wind it gets textured: goosebumps!,The moon's lack of wind preserves its texture.,Because the moon has no wind the texture of it's cratered surface never changes or erodes.
旬,"Hint: Here's info from Wikipedia regarding why this kanji exists, which helped me remember it: [Japan also divides the month roughly into three 10-day periods. Each is called a jun (旬). The first is jōjun (上旬); the second, chūjun (中旬); the last, gejun (下旬). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, ""the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April""; ""a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month.""].",Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a decameron) for calling this Kanji DECAMERON. See 殉 (#872).,"If you bind up ten days, you get a decameron."
勺,A ladle binds drops together.,Forget about the primative 'bound up'. Imagine instead the shape of a ladle and holding it upside down to drink the last DROP (of water).,I'm bound and determined to get that last drop with this ladle!
的,I managed to hit the bull's eye by throwing my white ladle.,"A white, bound up, drop in the center is the bull's eye. (why Heisig had to use ""ladle"" instead of the original two primitives that make up ""ladle"" I'll never understand!)","This kanji is used most commonly for 的（てき）or teki, which is the Japanese equivalent to the English suffix '-ly'. Example: 基本的（きほんてき）or kihonteki: kihon means 'basic' or 'standard' so kihonteki means 'basically'."
首,One has a strong NECK if one can carry HORNS on ONESELF.,"The V shape is your neck on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. Yourself, or the rest of your body is below that!","When I think of a neck, I think of a giraffe. This kanji is just a pictograph of giraffe's face, with those little horns on top and a big nose."
乙,"This is a fish hook, that pulls out the fishguts.","Really this will rarely be seen as fishguts as a Kanji, usually it's 2nd party, or latter, generally always meaning 2nd in some way. It's easy to remember this as ""2nd"" since it looks like a 2. Then just remember it's a fishhook primitive like any other kanji that changes it's meaning as a primitive.","""Knife goes in, guts come out"" (-Bart Simpson's mantra as he guts fish in ""30 Minutes Over Tokyo""). To be more specific: first, cut a 乙-shape in the belly of the fish, second, pull the fishguts out. (Note that the most common meaning of this kanji is not 'fishguts' as Heisig connotates, but 'second')."
乱,The riot police broke up the riot by dragging the rioters away by their tongues with fishooks.,A tongue with a hook can cause a riot.,"If my daughter took her tongue and pierced it with a fishhook, that would cause her mother and I to riot!"
直,"If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital straightaway.","I caught a freaky creature with ten eyes on my fish hook, so I threw it back straightaway.","Meanings: (1) Straightaway; straight (ahead); (2) direct; upright; erect; (3) straightforward; honest; frank. People who are frank, honest and straightforward live by the ethos: cross my heart and hope to die; stick a needle in my eye; if I ever tell a lie (the big L is for LIE)."
具,Keep an eye on your tools while you work at the table.,You need a strong tool to remove the legs from a shellfish.,"One tool nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench.

真,A compass is a tool with a needle on top that points to true north.,Ten tools are all a true craftsman needs.,Ten eyes working together are the best tools to see what's true.
工,I-beams are used to CRAFT skyscrapers.,I consider craft to be one of the harder primitives to use in stories so I've personified it as Bender the crafty robot from Futurama who was designed to bend I-beams.,I crafty.
左,"The LEFT side of my brain posesses the faculties needed for logical crafts, like engineering.","The left side of my brain, is for crafts.","FOR THOSE ABOUT TO PUZZLE OVER THE CHANGING STROKE ORDER, IT'S THIS SIMPLE: Look at the second primitive! Here, the first stroke of by one's side should match the first stroke of craft so that the stroke direction alternates in writing. So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal... 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical... 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical... etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [雄 (#804) 雄], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)...)"
右,The right side of my brain is for speaking.,Always keep your right to free speech (mouth) by your side!,By my side is a big mouth who thinks they're always right.
有,"Possessed by the Earth's gravity, the moon stays by its side.","To possess = have or own something.

召,To seduce is to make a sword of one's mouth.,"召す 【めす】 (v5s,vt) (1) to call; to send for; (2) to put on; to wear; to take (a bath); to ride in; to buy; to eat; to drink; to catch (a cold); (P) This kanji isn't anything sexual or anything. It means SUMMON/TO SEND/CALL FOR (as well as honorific form of eat/drink). STORY: A king is having a hard time EATING a piece of of meat b/c it can't fit in his MOUTH, so he CALLS FOR/SUMMONS someone to bring him his SWORD.

STORY: Darth Vader, the vice-ruler in the Galaxy (second only to Emperor Palpatine) protects the wealth 畐 of the empire by wielding his lightsaber 刂."

町,"Actually this means town, like one that has lots of streets and is surrounded by all the rice fields.","Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. ""Pillage the village, for the rice and and the tea."" the street primitive on the right looks like a 't'.","Note: the keywords of 町 (#96) and 村 (#221) swap places in translated editions of RTK I. In fact, according to different dictionaries, 町 is closer to 'town' whereas 村 is closer to 'village'."
可,"A mouth on the street asking for things: ""Can I get some help?! Can I get directions, Can I have some money? Can you please speak English?!""",I can eat nails.,A square box can fit in a corner.
頂,If I put a street sign on my head what do I get ? A place on the head !,"You've probably noticed that even the rudest and crudest Japanese say ""Itadakimasu"" before every meal. Why? Because each person who failed to say it as a child had a nail driven straight into that tender PLACE ON THE HEAD (i.e. the very top of the head). That's a lesson no one will forget!","Driving down the STREET, looking at a PAGE in the map, I hit another car, and started bleeding from a place on the head."
子,A child who is ten will still ask for his ma (top looks a bit like katakana ma).,"A pictograph of a child, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?).

呪,"Caution: this means a spell, not to swear. I put a curse on my elder brother so that he can never open his mouth.","There's an ancient curse in this region whereby the firstborn son, i.e. the elder brother, is always born with an extra mouth. And regardless of the elder brother's own personality, the extra mouth is bad tempered and always cursing.","In Harry Potter, Ron tried to put a curse on his older brother, but it backfired and he ended up with slugs in his mouth."
克,Ten elder brothers can overcome anything.,A teenager addicted to heroine must overcome the needle.,"Having ten older brothers would be hard to overcome. Ten mouths, and ten sets of legs kicking the crap out of you."
小,A little penguin with its wings at its side.,Little little little drops...,"A depressed child, head low and arms hung low, because he's too little to ride the roller coaster."
少,Only a few people can make an ugly face like that.,"Few usually refers to three. To emphasize three, we underline the three drops in little.","A happy grin, after a few drinks."
大,A person stretching their arms and legs to look large and scare a bear away.,How large? This large!,Think of a large St. Bernard dog with his paws all stretched out.
多,Two evenings too many!,"Many moons ago.. or perhaps it was just a couple of evenings, I can't remember.","This reminds me of a childish pseudo-confucion rhyme: ""He who eats many prunes sits on toilet many moons""."
夕,"The evening is young, the moon is not full.","In the evening, the crescent moon hangs in the sky.",When I come back home from work in the evening I say tadaima.
汐,"Eventide is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water.",Drops of water shower the beach as the evening tide approaches: eventide.,Eventide is when the drops of water are attracted to the moon. This is the tide which occurs in the evening.
外,A young magician likes to practice outside in the evening with his magic wand (as opposed to the old magician who wakes early to practice with his wand in 卓 (#52)).,"Outside in the dark of evening, only a magic wand can help you.",The evening is magical outside.
名,"In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your name so that people can recognise you.","In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my name.","Because it's dark in the evening, you need to open your mouth and speak your name to identify yourself. (This is a traditional mnemonic for this kanji)."
石,Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of cliff just in time to evade the huge STONE rolling out of the mouth of the cave!,"If you pick the right stone, and hit the kanji 右 right on its head really hard, you can chip off the upper stroke from it.",A stone covers the entrance to a cave hidden under a cliff.
肖,It doesn't hold a candle to the real thing. They share a resemblance at most.,"This kanji bears a resemblance to sparks on a candle. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.)",A candle bears resemblance to a little light from the moon.
硝,That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured nitrate acid on it.,"Salpetre is the common name for Nitrate coming from Latin ""sal petrae"" or stone salt. It is also a component of gun powder so including a candle in this kanji can be quite explosive!",That stone resembles nitrate.
砕,To SMASH a STONE you need to hit it NINE or TEN times.,The Stones (the Rolling Stones) are 90 aged but they've done a new SMASH hit!,A stone will smash a car-window nine times out of ten.

光,A ray of light is not a wave but made of little photons with human legs.,The ray from Honey I Shrunk the Kids made people little - ha! look at them run around on their tiny legs!,Imagine a ray gun shooting someone and their body exploding (sparks) and just their legs left.
太,A large person with a big drop of sweat dripping off of him because he is so plump.,"To keep this distinct from the primitive meaning of ""round"" (""fat man"") I suggest to use a specific image, such as that of a plump Japanese sumo wrestler, and let the drop between the legs be the loincloth (which compared to their large body size, is quite a drop). To illustrate the importance of this, have a look at the kanji for ""tenacious"" (frame 1506) and ""burdensome"" (frame 1986).",PLUMP people are LARGE and SWEAT a lot.
器,Imagine four hungry mouths all sitting around the table. They are all banging their utensils on the table waiting for a big meal to be placed in the centre.,"Note: 器 by itself means container/caliber/vessel. And 食器 means eating utensils (""food container"", hehe).","Don't limit the meaning of utensil here to forks and knives. This kanji means any kind of gadget, device or instrument. You can use it with 具 (tool) to mean ""gadget"" 器具 (きぐ), with the kanji of music 楽 it becomes ""musical instrument"" (器楽 = きがく) and it can even mean ""talent"" or ""capacity"". My story: 4 MOUTHS with their utensils/instruments engaged in a BIG activity (either working on a BIG project, maybe singing in a BIG orchestra, or waiting for a BIG meal)."
臭,The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the stinking smell comes from.,I have just done a big one. It's really stinking.,"In German there is the saying ""self praise stinks"" (Eigenlob stinkt). So, making yourself 自 look big 大 stinks."
嗅,Your mouth stinks: you need to sniff your breath.,"Smell. Mouth agape, nose in the air, a chihuahua smells some BBQ miles away. NOTE: Assigned keyword ""sniff"" in RTK Newly Approved General Use Kanji Supplement.","Interesting fact: when dogs sniff something interesting, they use both their nose (held high above them), and their mouth too. There's an organ linking the nose and mouth called the vomeronasal organ that picks up extra scents. So think of this next time you see a dog sniffing with mouth slightly open (chihuahua or st Bernard, depending on if you use the unofficial simplified character without dot or not). Of course if the thing is really stinking 臭 (#128), the dog may only need to use its nose alone!"
妙,Exquisite women are few and far between.,"A geisha is an exquisite and delicate (another meaning of this kanji) women, however, even in the past there was only few of them.",Exquisite women are few.
省,You focus by concentrating your eye on fewer objects.,"To remember the order: When focusing, keep a few things your TOP priority, so only they come UNDER your sight.",Few distractions will catch your eye if you have FOCUS.
厚,The thick cliff walls protected the children from the sun.,"In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have thick skin.","The japanese word for thick is atsui which is a homophone for hot, a kid under a cliff with the sun baking down on him would be hot indeed, especially if he had a thick sweater on.

奇,Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How strange!,"A dog that can do the ""Can Can"" would be a STRANGE sight indeed.",Big things can be strange.

州,There were 3 little islands in the stream who all decided to set themselves up as independent states.,"シュウ　The original meaning of this character was ""sandbar"", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American states. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by state after state as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.",All powerful STATES grew from a few small settlements along RIVER.
順,"""Obey, Obey!"" says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a stream of orders to fill your head.","In Japan, obeying means following the stream of collective opinion BEFORE using your own head.",Obey the orders streaming down from head office.
水,"The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig's story doesn't do this).","For those having issues with this* ""A 7K foot pool of water"" Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.",When you squeeze a stream you get water.
氷,Icicles start with 1 frozen drop of water.,A drop in temperature turns water into an icicle.,"This character and 永 (#139) are somewhat confusing. If you can remember how they're written but often take one for the other, imagine that eternity is above water and all the other elements, while icicles are to the side of a half-frozen waterfall."
永,It would take an eternity to count all the drops of water.,"It takes but one drop from the most special water: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an eternity. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).",What is your life? A DROP of water on a mini FLOOR when compared to ETERNITY!
泉,"White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.","Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).","A fresh SPRING has plenty of frothy white bubbles in its crisp, cool water."
腺,A body part that acts like a spring for hormones is a gland.,"Sweat and saliva glands act like a spring for fluids. (combining everyone's stories in one mnemonic, thanks mantixen).","Part of your body that springs out sweat, your sweat glands."
原,Follow the springs down the cliff and you will find a nice meadow.,"Forget about ""spring"" because the water primitive is abbreviated to ""little"". This is easy to forget by the time you've finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high cliff. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking meadows. And what on earth are those white little things? Wow, they're sheep! This cliff must be really high!","When in a meadow, the japanese girls who are white and small search for the shadow of a cliff to avoid taning."
願,Let's petition to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.,"Japanese hippies PETITION to save a meadow by getting people on the street to sign their page - as you pass by they call out: ""お願いします、おねがいします。”.","To save the meadow from development, a page of signatures was submitted as a petition."

沼,A marsh is where water is seduced into the ground.,"The marshlands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water--splash!",The marsh looks just like dry land. Really it's water and it seduces people to step onto it and they sink to their death.
沖,Open sea is a lot of water in the middle of nowhere.,Water in the middle of the ocean is referred to as open sea.,"Out in the water, in the middle of the ocean, is open sea with no land for miles and miles."
汎,"This is pan- as in the prefix meaning ""all"". I think of Pangea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now.","After Pan-Am crashed yet another plane into the water, their reputation dropped to mediocre.",Peter Pan is pretty mediocre in the water.
江,A CREEK is a small trail of water easily crafted with a stick.,"Creeks are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.","Using water and some craft, one can make a creek."
汰,"I couldn't find any reference to this kanji as meaning cleanse. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰（さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to 'select' so maybe Heisig meant cleanse in the ethnic sense here.. I'm going to use the keyword ""selection"", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.",Water is used to cleanse a plump man's colon.,"If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to CLEANSE you."
汁,To make soup you just take water and add (+) the rest of your ingredients.,To make soup you just take water and add ten tasty ingredients.,Water and ten ingredients can become a good soup!
沙,To keep this separated from 砂 (#122): Water erodes away stone a few grains of sand at a time until there is no stone left.,Each water wave washes away a few grains of sand.,"This kanji is used in a lot of girl’s names. 理沙(りさ)、沙織(さおり)、沙百合(さゆり). Maybe guys can think of this kind of like the classic advice there a lots of fish in water(ocean), lots of girls out there for you. You might think that it's hopeless and there are only a few girls out there, but girls are like grains of sand. Keep looking for the right one!"
潮,"The morning tide is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.",If it's not Eventide (汐) it must be morning tide!,The water rises with the morning tide.
源,The water that flows from the meadow is the source of life for the wild antelope.,Water is the source of a meadow's beauty.,The source of clean water is from the 原 (#142): it comes from that spring at the bottom of the cliff. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in spring. The water's clean. Trust me.
活,"Conversations can become more lively after everyone has had a few drinks. It's because ""watery tongues"" loosen lips!",Water comes off the lively speaker's tongue.,氵 (“water”) + 舌 (“tongue”) – a wet tongue. Ancient Chinese thought that a wet tongue was a sign of life.
消,"To extinguish a SPARK, you need WATER.",You need a few drops of water to extinguish the candle.,"To extinguish fire, use water or something resembling it."
況,"If you ask your teenager if what he's drinking is water (and not Vodka), he will answer ""but of course"".","キョウ But of course, this character really means ""situation/condition"". ""Elder brother gulped some water and said, 'What the hell was Heisig's mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION. But of course, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, water quaffing, situation assessing, sober elder brother), his SITUATION may improve.'""　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況　(じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions].",Would you like to throw water on your elder brother? But of course!
河,A river CAN exist only if there is WATER.,"I kept confusing this with stream. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial river. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow River in China (黄河), and the other is the Milky Way (銀河). Now I either think of the Little Engine that could dragging a bunch of stuff down a river in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.",With enough water you can make a river.
泊,Please supply a guest who stays overnight with WATER and WHITE sheets.,Overnight water white (it rhymes).,The water is white cuz it froze overnight.
湖,"This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the lake and looking at the MOON reflected in the lake. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.",Water reflects the old moon in the lake.,Tip: Heisig later combines old and moon into 胡 胡 (#2537). Story: Drinking water straight from the lake is rather uncivilized. (OR: Uncivilized communities get their water straight from the lake.
測,A fathom is the unit you use when making rules about water's depth.,You can't fathom how deep this water is. Perhaps you should use a ruler to measure it?,"HINT: I find 測 and 則 confusing. For 則 則 (#92)Heisig describes the keyword as a rule (regulation). Then in 測 (#160) he suggests 則 is a ruler or measure! Whatever stories you choose, don't loose sight of the meaning: 則 = rule (regulation, law), 測 = fathom (measure, conjecture)."
土,"Remembering soil is easy. If soil is soft, you can take a walking stick and plunge it two* feet into the ground.",The grave was marked by a cross sticking out of the soil.,Soil is neither positive nor negative.
吐,SPIT goes from my MOUTH to the GROUND.,"The only things that come out of my MOUTH and onto the GROUND are spit and vomit. Everything else (words, song) floats on the air.","Means vomit as well. a more decent way to say what you thow up could be ""mouth soil""."
圧,The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous pressure.,The cliff exerts a lot of pressure on the ground beneath it.,"For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives."
埼,"This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear.",A CAPE is a piece of LAND that stands out STRANGLY in the sea.,"Cape Cod ""odd"" is a land where odd=strange things happen."
垣,"Before the Great Wall of China, there was a dirt hedge that spanned across.",The HEDGE of roses growing from the castle grounds fully spanned the castle walls.,The HEDGE spans the GROUNDS of the estate.
填,"In a hole in the ground, the body of the victim was placed. And then the killer stuffed it up so that the truth would not be found out, he hoped.","For a geologist, inlayed right in the ground is the truth.","This is one of those times when I think Heisig didn't pick up a very good keyword. 填る can mean tons of things, but the keyword here is ""to fit"". As a passive verb (填る = はまる): 1) to fit/go into 2) to be suited for 3) to get stuck/caught 4) to be deceived; fall into a trap 5) to be addicted to / As an active verb (填める = はめる): 1) to insert 2) to have sex 3) to place an object around something (one that restricts freedom, such as handcuffs) 4) to entrap; to set someone up."
圭,Piling SOIL upon SOIL for aeons is how SQUARE JEWELS are formed deep in the earth.,How would you stop someone stealing your biggest square jewel? Bury it deep in the soil under ground. Then plant ivy to mark the spot.,"I've found something very useful in the forum: Katsuo said ""圭 is a name kanji, and not part of the 1,945 Joyo set. It often appears as part of other characters, and this is presumably why Heisig included it in RTK1. Rather than use ""square jewel"", however, he assigns it the primitive name ""ivy"" when forming other kanji. Checking Halpern's dictionary, the original meaning is ""ceremonial jade tablet with a rectangular base and pointed end used by the emperor in ancient China in appointing feudal lords."""
封,The king used a special seal of ivy leaves glued onto his document.,Squared jewels with the right measurements receive the jeweler's seal of approval.,"A bit of ivy glued to a letter can make a lovely SEAL when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart."
涯,Try to reverse Heisig's story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant horizon is nothing but water.,Over the WATER and past the HORIZON there is said to be a CLIFF that holds a very rare JEWEL.,"Across the water, I can see ivy covered cliffs on the horizon."
寺,"At the Buddhist temple the monks are seated on the ground, glued there in meditation.","To be allowed to join the Buddhist temple, imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the soil for a long time in a measurement of his resolve.",It is ironic that the kanji for Buddhist temple is composed by two elements Buddhism is meant to alleviate: earthliness and attachment.
時,"When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it's time to get up.","In ancient Japan, TIME of ''day'' was announced at the ''buddhist temples''. They did this by ringing large iron bells. This is similar to churches who ring their bells to announce the time of day.",A day at a Buddhist temple is TIME well spent.
均,Soil is scooped up into a ladel. The extra drop is brushed off to make it level.,"匀 = equal, not ladle 勺 = ladle. > so the story would be equal soil is equal to leveled ground.","To remember the extra stroke in the ladle, make a vivid image of a big drop of excess soil fr0m the ladle falling out onto the ground when you level it."
火,"For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on fire!","To be honest, it just looks like the flames of a fire to me.",Looks like a flame of a campfire with two drops of sparks flying off.
炎,To fight fire with fire would just inflame a situation.,An inflammation can often feel like FIRE upon FIRE burning.,"If you have an INFLAMMATION, it feels like there's fire above and below your skin."
煩,An anxiety feels like FIRE in the HEAD.,Imagine the anxiety a librarian would feel if the library caught fire and all the pages of his books were burning up.,"Many performers get ""Michael Jackson anxiety"" wherein they fear their head will catch on fire."
淡,"Drink water and burn twice as many calories as you eat... you'll definitely get thin. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being burned from above and below... THAT's what it takes to become thin.",Adding water to an inflammation sure will make it a thin fire.,"NB - This Kanji is confusing and doesn't actually mean 'thin' in most examples. It most commonly means pale or plain, as in pastel colours. Here's a story for your new keyword: Drink water if your inflammation makes you pale."
灯,Imagine old gas lamps which had a flame to light up the street signs.,A lamp is fire you can hang from a nail.,"When this symbol was created, a lamp was simply a fire at the side of the street."
畑,Many farms are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.,"This kanji actually makes a boatload of sense. In Japan, rice farmers are constantly making little fires on their rice farms burning up all the old stalks and things probably to be used as fertilizer. In moving to Japan, I found this practice to be very new and odd to me. So I would venture to guess that's exactly where this kanji comes from. If not, it certainly makes it really easy to remember.","When creating a farm, the prospective farmer must first set fire to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the fields. Fire before fields to make a farm."
災,"What a disaster! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs.","Don't know about Japan, but here in Australia, flooding rivers and bushfires are the most common natural disasters.","There's a flood upstairs, and a fire in the basement. I think it's safe to say that this is a disaster."
灰,The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.,"After the cremation fire, many prefer to scatter their loved-one's ASHES from seaside cliffs.","Scene from ""The Big Lebowski"" : Walter scatters Donny's ashes, but a wind blows much of the ashes into ""The Dude"" Lebowski's face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting ""Fuck it, man. Let's go bowling."" I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate (fire) Walter right there and then, at the top of the cliff! (thanks Elktapestry)."
点,The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the spot because she was accused of being a witch.,"Alternate meaning of the kanji is mark, or points. Like japanese tests are graded from 0 to 100 depending on how many percent of the questions they got correct. Before I learned any alternate meaning to this I took it as percentage = statistics. Now, wouldn't some pure and concrete statistics be just the thing you need to set that fortune tellers mind on fire? Relate the setting him/her on fire to the entry for 煩 (#175) if it helps. :).","This kanji also means grade, or %. てん A student at an exam is like a fortune teller, fired up by enthusiasm and eagerness to get a good grade, red spots lit up on his face from the excitement."
照,SHINING FLAMES illuminate!,"The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we illuminate the night.",Just shining is not enough to illuminate. The shiny thing needs to be even brighter. Maybe set it on fire?
魚,"The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind fish.","That fish was caught, BOUND UP, then carried across RICE FIELDS, and finally cooked over an OVEN FIRE.",Bind that FISH and cook his brains! Yarhh!
漁,You need WATER and FISH for fishing.,"""FISHING For Idiots"", Chapter One: Fish are generally found in water.","If you are confusing this with angling like me, take fishing to mean not the act of catching a fish but the act of being a fish not living but fishing (i.e. in the water)."
里,The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD.,"Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You'll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: House of the Parents.","My parents' house is on a rice field; I compute the ground area being one ri by one ri. 古里 (ふるさと) : home town, birthplace, old village, historic village, native place, one's old home; 郷里 (きょうり) : birth-place, home town."
黒,"If you burn the GROUND of a RICE FIELD with FIRE, eventually it will turn black.","If your parent's home catches on fire, it will turn black.",Burning a computer is ri-diculous. It just leaves everything all BLACK.
墨,Theres BLACK on the GROUND...most likely someone spilt some black ink.,Black ink comes from black soil.,Anyone who has worked with laserjet ink cartridges will know the black ink looks like powdered dirt.
鯉,Japanese carp are massive fish - they are measured in ri!,"Robocarp!!! Part fish, part computer! Visualise him flapping and clanking down the street, with bullets richoting off his scaly armour.",In front of my parents' home is a fish pond full of carp.
量,"I did such a quantity of work that when NIGHT BREAK came, I was asleep on the COMPUTER.",A quantity can be a measure of time or space (day/ri).,I have such a huge quantity of kanji to review that night break usually finds me in front of my computer reviewing the kanji.
厘,"I threw my Rindows computer off a cliff because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it's worth less than a rin.",A computer dropped off of a cliff would be worth about 1 RIN.,"Note: The rin is an obsolete unit of Japanese currency equal to yen. Due to the drastic devaluation of Japanese money after World War II, the rin was eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953."
埋,"You can't bury computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.",I used SOIL to BURY my COMPUTER.,"Bury me in the soil beside my parents' house. That's where I want to be laid to rest. 埋め込む (うめこむ) : to bury; 埋蔵 (まいぞう) : buried property, treasure trove."
同,Imagine monks wandering around the monastery. Covered in their hoods and chanting as if with one mouth they all look the same !,One mouth under a hood looks the same as any other.,Everyone looks the same under a hood. All you can see is one mouth.
洞,All the animals in the den share the same water.,"""Den"" and ""cave"" also make me think of a monk's cell. Monks take vows of silence and fast. So a den is where you'd find nothing but water (to drink) and a monk. 洞 ほら cave, den, grotto; 洞窟 どうくつ cave; 洞察 どうさつ discernment; insight.",Animals always build their den in the same place - beside the water.
胴,"Dead flesh all looks the same when you chop off everything but the trunk. Yes, I'm appalled at how gruesome this story is too.","A trunk, a trunk // The body of a monk // The body of a monk in a trunk, a trunk.",The trunk (torso) of everyone's body is mostly the same.
向,Look over yonder ! That tiny dot is robin hood at the mouth of his secret cave !,"The spaceman died screaming, his MOUTH wide open because someone has cut the oxygen cable from the HOOD/HELMET of his space suit. As his last DROPs of oxygen escaped into the vastness of space he thought to himself, So much for flying off into the wild blue YONDER.",Over yonder usually refers to somewhere far away. For this kanji think of the aliens way over yonder who have an antenna popping out of their helmet which encloses but a single mouth.
尚,An especially esteemed alien has three antennae on his helmet.,I have little self-esteem.. so I keep my face under a hood and my mouth shut.,"Remember that scene from Star Wars, where Luke is wearing that helmet that only his mouth could see, and was swinging at that little thing buzzing around the room? That was Obi-Wan's trick to get Luke to build his self-esteem, or his confidence in the Force."
字,CHILDren learn Kanji characters underneath a HOUSE.,"""Why do I have to wear this roof on my head all the time father?"" ""Shut up! It builds character!""",The first kanji characters you will learn in Japan is probably learnt at home (in the house of your family) when you are still a child. Imagine a really small preschool child doing this (to prevent confusing house with school like in 学 (#346)).
守,"A GUARD is usually ""glued"" to the house he watches.",A guard provides a measure of security to those under a roof.,A good GUARD should stick to your house like glue and be willing to take any measures to protect you.
完,Make the perfect impression in the beginning by removing your shoes upon entering a Japanese home.,"In the beginning, Adam and Eve had a home in Eden. It was perfect.",Their new house was the perfect place to begin a family.
宣,You can proclaim your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet.,"I keep thinking about the Irish one-hit band the Proclaimers, who promised to walk 500 miles -- quite a long SPAN -- to reach your HOUSE.","A local official proclaims a curfew spanning sunset to sunrise - you must stay under your own roof during that time span. I keep wanting to add in the ""words"" 言 primitive. Don't think about someone reading it aloud - focus on the CURFEW that was proclaimed. I also tend to confuse this one with 詔 (#342). Remember this proclamation comes from a petty local official."
宵,I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the WEE HOURS reviewing the kanji!!!,"I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means ""early evening"", not ""wee hours"" [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 ""but of course"" -- what the hell???). Oh well.] ""Every house lights candles in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the wee hours"". E.G. 宵の口（よいのくち）early evening; 今宵（こよい）this evening; tonight.","In the wee hours, you need a candle to see your way around the house."
安,"It's funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman relaxing. Cheapest place to do that is in one's own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? 家で休暇を取るは安いですね。.",Cheapest place for a woman to relax is in her own home.,"アン、やす・い　The cheapest way to relax is to stay at home with your woman. 安心 (あんしん, peace of mind)…　Pure Group:　案214."

桂,"Simple mnemonic : ""The Japanese Judas-tree is the tree on which Judas hang himself to the ivy"" (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using ivy as a if it was a rope.","A tree covered in poison ivy will quickly betray you, thus the name JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE.","The Katsura (Japanese Judas-tree) is a thin tree (sort of like the stretched out 木 used in this kanji) with little green (the color of an emerald, a jewel) leaves. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_(tree)."

Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn't escape the important scripted scenes.)","Pfft. At it's core, a town is just a bunch of wood glued together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.","There is a mix up, this kanji means むら=village, not town.

札,Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing tags on them.,"Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for ""Paper Money"" w/ the reading さつ (千円札＝1000 Yen paper bill)... It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (""trump"" playing cards). For the tag meaning I like to think of wooden tags hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to ""hook you in"" so to speak.",In order to put a tag on a tree you need a hook.
暦,"Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a cliff to form or erode. A tree takes many months to grow.

薄,A Dr. missing his needle can only use dilute flower water for medicine.,"[As suggested by stehr and on the forum (http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079), we create a new keyword 'seaweed' for the flower on top and water below and to the left. See also 落 (#299), 藩 (#1912),藻 (#2035). This story is for people using that idea.] The homeopath (a doctor without any needle) specialises in dilute medicines. This one's an essence of seaweed -- just dip the seaweed into the beaker, swish it about and remove. Barmy!","Note This character belongs to a set of characters which share the flower/water primitive such as:: 薄 (#227), 落 (#299), 藩 (#1912), and 藻 (#2035).... (落 薄 藩 藻) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like seaweed or watering can) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like Sino 満 and Full 満, where the water primitive is larger than the flower primitive."
葉,"On top of the leaves a flower appears, promising new generations for the old tree below.","Tip: New primitive: Let Tarzan = generation + tree -- because Tarzan lives with several generations of his family at the top of a tree. (This combination appears five times: leaf (FRAME 228), 蝶 (#560), 喋 (#2280), 諜 (#2757), 牒 (#2934)). Story: In the flower shop you see Tarzan trying on various leaves (which he wears to cover his private parts).",The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.
模,"If I find out this furniture you're selling me is made of imitation wood, I'll put you in the graveyard.","The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put IMITATION plastic trees in their graveyards! (No, not really, but I wouldn't be surprised).","In graveyards, everything is fake, the flowers, the sun, and the little happy dogs. Heck, even the trees are just imitations. It's a clean aesthetic that's supposed to help people recover, but all the imitation material really unnerves me."
漠,The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are vague.,"The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is vague.",The mist and fog surrounding the graveyard make things appear vague and unfamiliar.
墓,The soil under a graveyard is full of graves.,A grave is a patch of soil in a graveyard.,"The flowers were blooming, the sun was shining, when I let my St. Bernard off his leash and he lifted his leg and peed ON some freshly turned soil that was dug out for a grave. [Thanks to dwhitman for the idea of the peeing dog because the way the last stroke for 大 is shifted rightwards would mess me up, but if the dog's got his leg up in the air... it's a nice visual image for the change from the primitive graveyard.)"
暮,He made a livelihood out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.,"I like trikatu's simple way to remember this, but just in case the primitive placements confuse you, change it around to this: Before you complain about your livelihood, think about spending your days under a graveyard.

膜,"In the moonlight of the graveyard I hear a zombie say, MMMMM..EMM...BRANEsssss.",The membranes in your flesh rot when placed in the graveyard.,"マク Membranes (thin layers of connective tissue) are the part of the body that decompose first (i.e., before the organs, ligaments, bones, etc.) after one dies and is buried in a graveyard."
苗,If you plant seedlings in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER.,Crap! There are flowers in the rice field... Who let those seedlings get in there?!,"This is obviously a flower sprouting from a rice field, and means ""rice seedling"" in Japanese. My problem is keeping this kanji distinct from 圥, which Heisig dubs the ""rice seedling"" primitive (see 陸 (#1631) ff.). It might help to keep in mind that 圥 is a rare kanji (not used in Japanese) meaning ""mushroom,"" so I will call 圥 the ""mushroom seedling""."
兆,A bad portent makes the hairs on your legs stand.,"Two persons turning their backs is a bad sign. Hint: Don't use ""turtle"" as a primitive. You'll save a lot of troubles with following kanji if you give this primitive the meaning ""a person's back"".",The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated turtle shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this turtle are a portent of evil bad luck.
桃,The pits of a peach tree look like turtles.,"If you used the story about hairy woman´s legs for portent, then: PEACH TREE is the TREE that has HAIRY fruits.",King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he's going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.
眺,Sauron's One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.,"You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn't fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don't need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with 挑 (#710) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl's story with some notes that helped me).","Litterally this kanji reads ""eye of portent"". Imagine an old lady starring into the crystal sphere trying to portend the future."
犬,"A large dog, dripping drool.","I don't know why not one single person before me has seemingly thought of this, but when I first encountered this character, it just seemed SO natural for me. It looks just exactly like a guy throwing a stick for his DOG to bring it back to him. Or am I really the only one seeing this picture?","If we remember 大 (#112) as a man with his arms outstretched, the drop represents man's best friend - a dog."
状,It was left to the turtle to make right with the dog and thus maintain the status quo.,A turtle mounting a chihuahua clearly disrupts the status quo.,"After beating the hare in a race, the turtle is now acknowledged to be the fastest animal.

荻,REEDS are the only FLOWERS that WILD DOGS like to FIRE up and smoke while they are playing poker.,A reed is a flower that looks like a hot dog.,"I turned 狄 into an element I call ""savages"" (""savages"" are like a pack of wild dogs gathered around a fire. NOTE: 狄 is a kanji depicting a certain tribe of barbarians from northern China. Since both of those keywords have been used in the RTK series, I chose ""savages"". Reeds are flowers that grow like savages."
狩,Actually when hunting it may be a good idea to use a pack of dogs as your personal guard.,"After a pack of wild dogs hunt some food, they will guard it fiercely.","In every prison escape movie, the hunt for the escapees involves a pack of WILD DOGS unleashed by the GUARDS."
猫,The cat hid in the FLOWERS of the FIELD from the WILD DOGs.,Packs of wild dogs will chase a cat through flowers and fields.,"Although it's counter to Heisig, this is one of the few kanji I find easier to remember as a picture; specifically, one of a cheshire cat. The bushy tail is on the left, the flowers at the top are the eyes narrowed to slits, and the rice field is the big, toothy grin."
牛,"A cow tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off.","This is a cow... Cow - How you say? Imagine a cow which has just been run over by a steamroller. Now you see, the head to one side, four legs and the tail backwards. Yes that is indeed a cow.",The cow ate the roots of the vermilion tree.
特,"Think of not special people, but special animals. The sacred Hindu cows are special - they can wander around the temple without fear of becoming roast beef.","Cows at a Buddhist temple are special - they are holy cows! Sadly a few days later I find the same cows' meat on special at the supermarket. Holy Cow, what have we done!?","The Church Lady is traveling through Japan and notices with distaste a sacred cow relieving itself inside a Buddhist Temple. ""Well, isn't that special""."
告,"The revelation makes the cow's mouth drop down, ""Hamburgers are made of what?!""","In ancient times, the words from a primitive cow's mouth were considered a REVELATION because they were the ""udder truth.""","When you get a revelation, you may drop to the ground with your mouth wide open."
先,I've never seen a cow with human legs before!,Before Human Beings Existed.. Minotaurs Ruled The Earth! Their Top Half A Cow And Their Bottom Half Human Legs! Also: Using Minotaur as a primitive can make stories a doddle!,"I've never seen a cow with human legs before! (from gaijinda) I keep mixing this up with 前 (#309). Remember that before sounds like ""beef or"", so it must be the one with the cow in it."

合,He had such a big mouth that he could easily fit one whole umbrella in it.,"Meeting of mouths! We fit together so well, darling ;).",This umbrella is so small you can only fit one mouth under it (one person).
塔,In order to build a pagoda in this small Japanese garden everything has to fit: the soil to the left and the flowers in the upper right corner.,"A pagoda is a place of harmony in Japan. This means that even the ""soil"" where ""flowers"" are planted must ""fit"" together (good for remembering the order of writing).","Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of soil on the left, and a little concrete pagoda in the front with flowers behind it.

玉,The king is said to have only one family jewel below the belt...,"I can tell you that there is only one thing that Japanese people think when they see this Kanji, and that's BALLS(no joke). Kintama, or gold balls, means testicles. Funny story, we met a European girl not to long ago who had this as a tattoo, and she thought it actually meant JEWEL. But as I said, the Japanese guys wanted to know why she liked BALLS so much. lol (True Story).","The king is said to have only one family jewel below the belt...and he hangs left!

玩,Even the king played with toys in the beginning.,The ball was the only thing that people at the beginning of time had to use as a toy.

In Japanese Shinto white is the holiest color.

理,The king of LOGIC is the computer.,Computers are ruled by logic (it is the king of computers).,"If you used the meaning ""House of the Parents"" for 里 (#185), you will know then that, as logic dictates, the King must rule on his own Kingdom (the House of his Parents)."
主,A lord is a little drop down from King in hierarchy.,A lord only has a drop of the king's power.,"Although this kanji's meaning hasn't caused me much trouble, I've had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the drop in jewel (#256). Both of them use the king primitive and include a short drop stroke going from the top left to bottom right."
注,"""WATER, my LORD ? I'll pour"".",Visualize an idiot trying to figure out how to extinguish a candle. He sees a glass of WATER and decides to pour it onto the CANDLESTICK to put it out. Water spills everywhere.,Like water the hot wax poured down the side of the candlestick.
柱,The main pillar in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the lord of the trees.,"""Wood Lord, what a pillar!"", she said.",This wooden pillar is like the lord of the house... (remove it and the whole house will collapse).
金,The fat king taking up the whole space under the umbrella actually isn't fat - he just has two big gold bars hidden under his clothes.,"Under the umbrella's shade, the king sang, "" Drop it to the left, drop it to the right, give me all the GOLD in sight!""","King Midas shelters from the rain under his umbrella. Every now and again he reaches out with his hands to turn a couple of raindrops into gold, and puts them in his pockets."
銑,"Pig-iron is crude metal (金) before (先) it is refined. If you have trouble with this character, envision a big minotaur (cow head with human legs) as a blacksmith, smelting metals and making swords for war.","100% of Japanese university graduates claim to have never seen this character, so impress them by remembering it, Pig-iron is metal before it has been processed. (Just a copy of the most common used story but with this little fact added, really impress your japanese friends or teachers by learning this one).",PIG-IRON is the condition of IRON BEFORE it has been processed.
鉢,"This is the BOWL of an alchemist: see how he mixes metals in his bowl, as he follows the instructions from his book?","If I was begging with a BOWL, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.",I actually picture a book made of gold that's been warped (due to the malleability of gold) so that it has a dent in the middle that can be used as a bowl.

That's why it's used for wires.",A metal that looks the same as gold is COPPER.
釣,All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I'm a pro. I bring a big-ass golden ladle. I'm a true ANGLING professional.,The easiest angling is pulling goldfish out with a big ladle.,Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago angling with a golden ladle instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because 'angling' is just the roman-derived way to say 'fishing' - use this to distinguish fishing from angling.)
針,Remember the story of the needle in the haystack. Why would someone even look for a needle if it wasn't a GOLD NEEDLE?,A golden needle is worth ten times more than an ordinary needle.,The golden needle is the true needle.

道,"When we go out on the ROAD-WAY, we often risk our own necks (that's why I take the train! ).","Good keyword selection by Heisig: while the primitive on the left means road, the whole kanji also has the meaning of way, or 'tao (teaching)'. Thus, road + way. (Check out the wikipedia article on the Chinese Philosophical concept of ""Tao"": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao. It's this character!).","Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel's neck over a dusty road.

迅,The car went too swiftly through the crossing and was hooked by the cops.,"In the Heisig version of Frogger, you can image ten giant fish hooks sweeping across the road, with our hapless hero 'froggy' forced to make a swift crossing or end up as fish bait.","If you spread fishguts all over a crossing, people will definitely want to cross over it very swiftly to get away from the awful smell!"

連,When you put your car on the road you should always take along a few friends. Don't confuse with 運 (#303).,"This kanji also means ""linked"" or ""series"" so I've changed the kanji meaning to ""GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER)."" Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD.

軌,My car got so stuck in a rut it required nine people pushing to get it out again.,My car got so stuck in a rut it required a baseball team pushing to get it out again.,"Hitler gets his CAR stuck in a RUT, so he yells ""Nein!

A car maybe?
喩,"Metaphorically speaking, all the equipment in your mouth is basically just a meeting of butchers, designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.","Metaphor: A good metaphor flows from the mouth like the meeting of flesh and saber, smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad metaphor is like when you barely nick the flesh and only spill two drops of blood or when your saber doesn't penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the flesh. (Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji (口＋兪) and the simplified form (口＋俞)) .",A meeting of butchers is a perfect metaphor for the supposed secret talks(mouth) between Hitler and Stalin.

煎,"In many asian restaurants, meat is roasted right in front of you over flames.","""I'm going to roast you over a fire , お前,"" the angry gangster said.",Put something in front of a fire to roast it.
各,Each person is gifted with a mouth to get us into trouble and a pair of walking legs to get us out!,"It's easier for me to remember a concrete object. This combination occurs often enough for me to make it a primitive element. Walking legs and mouth combine to give a ""walky talky"" or mobile phone. Imagine one of those old big ones which looked like refridgerators. Mobile phones are so popular that each of us seems to want one.",EACH of us learns first to use our legs to walk and then to use our mouths to talk.

賂,"It might sound simple to bribe someone, but then you have to graft the guy above him and the guy below him, and soon you're just giving shells to each and everyone!","Graft: the acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one's position or influence in politics, business, etc. .

処,The best way to dispose of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.,To dispose of rubbish you should walk it to the bin not throw it to the wind.,"Contrast this with 捨 (#707).

条,They all say they have a TREE between their WALKING LEGS but most only have a TWIG.,"Don't confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping twigs. A twig is always the kind of wood that snaps when the hunter's walking legs just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter's presence.",I don't believe this means twig as in a tree twig. 条 【じょう】 (n) (1) article (in document); provision; (2) stripe; streak; line.

落,Water each flower or the petals will wither and fall.,"[It's been suggested on the forum (http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079) that flower across the full width of the kanji and water on the left below it should have its own keyword; seaweed is a popular choice. See also 薄 (#242), 藩 (#2061), 藻 (#2191). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers falling through the sky -- suddenly each one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori seaweed to carry them safely down.","""Flowers"" need ""water"" ""each"" day or they'll bend and fall over (helps with the order of writing)."

He must inherit it.",That crown was glued together from the beginning...I swear!
夢,Last night's date with Miss Sweden was like a dream.

So I imagine the sun raining down on the clouds instead.","The sun is above the clouds, the definition of cloudy weather."
雷,"If it's raining and you're standing in the middle of a rice field, you're sure to soon become acquainted with the thunder up close and personal.","Thunder is a sure sign of rain coming. When you hear the thunder, you've got time to get out of the field before it starts raining.","I've been told by Japanese people that this word, 雷（かみなり）　means BOTH thunder and lightning together. Though there is no individual word for thunder, there is for lightning (いなずま）, so I understand where Heisig is coming from. Just remember a powerful storm over an empty field and you're sure to remember this kanji."
霜,"FROST is kind of an inter-weather, phenomenon, something between rain, snow and freezing temp’s.",The inter-action between rain and cold makes frost.,"The freezing RAIN formed FROST on the TREE right before your EYES. If you want, frost-y then think Frost Tree to get to the mnemonic. SECOND STORY: FROSTY the snowman? It's RAIN that FROSTS that can then INTER-act with the kids, till he melts of course."
冬,"Don't slip off your legs in winter, strap two skis to your feet.",In winter my walking legs feel like blocks of ice.,"In Winter, there's ice beneath your walking legs! Be careful, even just two icelets could slip you up!"
天,"If you think of the sky as a ceiling above our heads, here you have the heavens as the largest ceiling you could ever imagine. As Heisig pointed out, nothing comes above the ceiling primitive thus the order of primitives is taken care of.","The ceiling that all large dogs aspire to go to is known as heaven. After all, All Dogs Go to Heaven.","Tip: 天 and 夭 (heavens and sapling) are different, but RTK confuses them sometimes.

妖,"If you don't want to get bewitched (and who would?), then avoid any woman you see carrying what might appear to be a sapling. It's really a wand in disguise, and if you're not aware you might get bewitched.","sigh. For some reason, Heisig never seems to understand the difference between 夭 and 天.

帝,"The crazy sovereign stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That's why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.","This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the standing element takes those little crown ""winglets"" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She's standing on her crown rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her apron.

昆,Grandparent spends all DAY COMPARING photos of their DESCENDANTS.,"Japanese people have compared themselves as being descendants of the sun. (Amaterasu, the sun godesss). Sun, comparing = descendants.","Ask a Japanese person what this kanji means, and they will surely spout 昆布 (konbu, seaweed)　and 昆虫 (konchu, insect) - but beyond that they will likely be mystified. Here's my best crack at it: imagine a grandfather watching his DESCENDENTS (grandkids) playing outside under the sun, silently comparing them, considering which of them will grow up and make him proud. Suddenly, grandma calls them in for a snack of 昆布 and for a re-application of repellent to keep the 昆虫 away."

渇,You awaken from your siesta because you feel extremely thirsty so you go looking for some water.,"If anyone is having difficulty creating stories with the primitive siesta, try changing it to beggar - a beggar sits in his box begging for food/money under a hot sun. I have used beggar as a primitive in several frames and it works like a charm. Here a beggar develops a deep thirst for water as he crouches in his box under the hot sun.","Have some water before you take a siesta, or you will wake up thirsty!"

A BEGGAR SPEAKS requesting an audience(to beg for money), a beggar's garments are usually 褐 (#490)(dirty), and beggars sleep so much when they open their mouth, their voice is 喝 (#491). (btw, chinese etymology: the bottom part of siesta means to beg)."

壱,The samurai who has been crowned number one is so good he uses a spoon to fight with rather than a sword.,"Imagine Neo (a futuristic samurai aka The One) wearing a Burger King crown, in the famous scene from the Matrix where he's told ""There is no spoon.""","Unlike roman numerals there's nothing archaic about the usage of this kanji. This is how you'd write 'one' on a cheque so the person you paying it to can't change it into a 'two' or a 'three'. So with that in mind, the hard up samurai (士) has been selling (売) his crown (冠) is now sitting down (匕), you give him a cheque for 1 yen, but are sure to customize it for him.

梅,"Plums actually grow on every single tree. What, you didn't know that? They do. Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees.

海,Every drop of water will eventually return to the sea.,There is water in every sea.,"As depicted in the classic SF film Fantastic Voyage, every drop of water is a sea, if you look close enough.

乾,"During a drought, everything begs for even a mist for relief.","During a drought, even mist is begged for.",Beggar has to drink mist because there is no water in the drought. I get this one confused with thirst 451 but try to remember that there is no water element beacuse it is a drought.
腹,The only body part that doubles over.,"Imagine getting punched in the abdomen, a fairly tender part of flesh, and instead of doubling forward, you double back. That would be pretty painful.",The part of the body (flesh) that is exercised when we lie down and bring our walking legs toward the sun (aka: leglifts) is the abdomen.
複,"My girlfiend saw someone wearing the exact same (duplicate) outfit at a party, so she doubled back to change!","In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione uses a device called a ""time-turner"" to double back in time, but this creates duplicates.

炊,"Japanese cooking sometimes lacks fire, e.g., sashimi.","This character shows the difference between a cook and a chef: a chef prepares food with passion and love; a cook only stands there with a pan over a fire, with no passion and just yawning.",How can you cook something when you lack fire?
歌,"Can-Can-ers lack the ability to sing a song, so they just dance.","Do you know the ""Obama song""? It goes like: ""Yes we can, yes we can!""

賠,Compensation is money you give to someone to shut them up (i.e. muzzle their mouth).,Compensation is a kind of euphemism for hush money here. Money that muzzles.,I expect compensation for the bite I recieved when you didn't muzzle your dog.

音,"If you were standing on the sun, believe me, you'd be making sound.","The tongue wagging in a mouth produces a very high-pitched sound, breaking a nearby vase.",Note that sound is very close to the muzzle primitive (it has the sun instead of the mouth at the bottom) - but in meaning they are precisely opposite!
暗,Picture the sun exploding - there would be a gigantic noise and then...nothing. Everything would plunge into darkness.,Total darkness lacks sun and sound.,"In places of complete darkness, such as caves where the sun can't reach, creatures such as bats have learned to navigate by sound rather than sight.

韻,What is a RHYME but some SOUND that EMPLOYEES say to get them through work.,"Dr Seuss's employee finally rebels against him: ""I'm tired of odd sounds all the time, I will not, cannot, speak in RHYME!""","A rhyme is the sound of an employee going off to work.

識,Words are difficult to discriminate/discern from sounds in the middle of a fiesta.,I wonder why Heisig didn't use discernment for this kanji. It fits the meaning equally and it is not as loaded as discrimination. // It is quite hard to discern words in the middle of a noisy fiesta.,I have discriminating taste. I'd rather listen to the words of a lecture than attend a kazoo concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).
鏡,Mirror should suggest vanity.

In this house, the owner has put mirrors on the boundary of his land so it feels much bigger.","Be aware the right-hand character 竟 really means ""endpoint"" or ""finally""; it's commonly read ""つい"" (as in ""ついに"") and usually written in kana alone. A boundary represents a country's land's endpoint (awkward phrasing for order) .","竟 = tsui (final, end). So 境 = SOIL + END, or the end of the land. End of the land = its perimeter, the boundary!"
亡,The top hat hanging on a hook belonged to the now deceased Charlie Chaplin.,The recently DECEASED are said to hang their hats on a hook by the door to the afterlife.,A deceased man's hat will forever rest on the hook.
盲,Deceased eyes! Easy ;).,A person with deceased eyes is blind.,"Rather than ""dead eyes,"" break down DECEASED into TOPHAT and FISHHOOK, and picture each blind person's EYES as being unable to see because their eyes are covered with a TOP HAT, that's attached to a FISHHOOK stabbed in their eyeballs."

So, here's my story: The delusional woman was carrying her deceased husband on her back.","If you think you should perish for that woman, you have a major delusion.","Remember ""The Corpse Bride""?

Must have been a ram, note the horns.",Our Lord and King put on ears and a tail to become a lowly sheep for the slaughter.,"(you might consider using something with a religious connotation when used as a primitive, like ""lamb of god"" or something, because sheep seems to appear in a lot of religious kanji)."
美,I guess this kanji proves it's not just the Welsh whose idea of beauty is a large sheep.,"Who is more beautiful, a sheep or a st. Bernhard dog?

又,"This keyword should really be ""again"" not ""or again"" Here is some context: think of the phrase ""Jya mata"" ""じゃ又"" which is a farewell similar to ""then again"". Also ""Mata ne"" ""又ね"" and mata ashita (again tomorrow) ""又明日""。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out ""mata"" except for in the last example: 又明日.","Cross you legs, or again I'll see your crotch.","As a primitive, instead of using ""crotch"", I also often use ""sat cross-legged"" as this also looks like the kanji."
双,The animals boarding Noah's Ark all came in pairs – but Noah had to carefully check the two crotches in each pair to ensure that the animals were of different sexes and thus able to further their species after the flood.,Crotch to crotch is how many pairs spend their private time together. . .,"The left crotch looks more like the man's and the right a woman's, the ultimate pair."
桑,"Children going around the mulberry tree singing ""This is the way we wash our crotch, wash our crotch, wash our crotch...""","Imagine kids all over the top of a mulberry tree, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their crotches. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old mulberry in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).","According to Wikipedia, ""unripe [MULBERRY] fruit and green parts of the plant have a white sap that is intoxicating and mildly hallucinogenic."" When looking at the MULBERRY tree, some have hallucinated that they are seeing crotches, crotches everywhere!"
隻,"Donald Duck is a big bird that does not wear pants. It's good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count vessels.",The turky's crotch is a vessel for the stuffing that you fill it with.,The USS Turkeycrotch is a seaworthy vessel.
護,"Think of the flower-vessels as a the Greenpeace vessel “Arctic Sunrise”, only instead of a rainbow there is a big flower painted on the hull (this will come back in 獲 (#757) and 穫 (#974)). Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. -- In this kanji, we see an inauguration speech being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to safeguard our planet.",Words and Flowers are exchanged between sailors and their wives before they board the vessel to safeguard the world.,"The flower vessel is of course the Mayflower in which the pilgrims came to America in their search for turkeys.

The drugs are then seized by the authorities.
奴,"That GUY stole my WOMAN so I kicked him in the CROTCH. (This story helps keep the word ""GUY"" as someone you hold in contempt).",Guys only care about 2 things: women and their crotch (preferably at the same time).,GUYS (derogatory) are always thinking about women's crotches. 1) 此奴 【こいつ】this guy. 2) 其奴 【そいつ】that guy. 3) 彼奴 【あいつ】that guy.
怒,This woman is angry because of the guys in the previous frame who pay more attention to her crotch than her heart. I prefer to decompose the kanji in three elements here because it is easier to read like a mnemonic.,WOMEN get very ANGRY over the thought that GUYS are more interested in her CROTCH than her HEART.,"When a guy steps on her heart, a woman can get quite angry."
友,"A good friend is always at your side. ---- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other's crotches in a joking manner. It's still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor's crotch is a great way to express friendship.",A friend is always on your side - again and again and again.,Your best friend is your crotch. Its always by your side and never lets you down.
抜,Don't let good friends slip out between your fingers.,"Imagine a cliché Hollywood situation: one person is lying on the edge of the abyss and another (presumably his friend) is hanging, only thing holding him is the grip of their hands. Then fingers slip out of the grip and he falls in said abyss.","Her fingers slipped out of mine as she said, 'I think we should just be friends...'"
投,"Well, you usually use your fingers to throw objects used as missile weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the missile primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it's a crotch (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the wind. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...",RPG. A wizard throws magic missiles from the tip of his fingers.,He's a great pitcher. He can throw a split finger fastball that's like a missile.
没,(Note: this kanji is more collapse/cave-in/沈 (#2033) than humans drowning) A water missile? A torpedo! And when it hits it's target? The ship collapses then sinks and everyone drowns!,"The submarine's hull was breached after being struck by a torpedo (""water missile""), causing the entire crew to drown.","I give this Kanji the keyword go down (in the sense of something plummeting or going down badly, not in the sense of descending, which is already used) because it is used in sinking (沈没), dying (戦没), and sunset (日没). It seems to me 溺 is the character for drown, and in fact it is given the keyword ""drowning"" later, which is just confusing to me. Story: The ship is going down! We were hit by a water missile (a torpedo)."
股,"Where's my flesh missile? Between my thighs, naturally...",Chun Li's thunder thighs -- the part of her body that lets her kick with the force and speed of a missile.,My thigh is the part of the body that my missile smacks against.
設,"Establishment can be attacked by words or by missiles. Writers will use words, whereas militars will use missiles.","When you attack the establishment with words, it fights back with missiles.","In the United States, we began by establishing justice with words (in our constitution), but somewhere along the line we began 'establishing justice' with missiles instead. :(."
撃,"Your car has missles?! That beats mine, hands down.",Think 3 methods of attack all combined into 1 kanji: 1. Vehicle to transport troops 2. Once troops have disembarked they have their missiles 3. If they run out of missiles they resort to hand to hand combat to beat the enemy.,"In a random version of rock,paper, scissors. A car is beaten by a missile that hits it, the missile is beaten by the hand that can type in the deactivation code (which in turn is beaten by the car that runs over it)."
殻,husk or shell. Japan's recent history in a nutshell: first the samurai became superfluous and then the Americans started to throw missiles and bombs during WWII.,"The primitives tie so nicely into a story: upon the use of missiles in warfare, the traditional role of samurai became superfluous in battle. How to tie it to the keyword of ""husk""? Easy! Afterwards, the samurai were demoted (like potato-peeling privates), and they sat around HUSKING corn and cracking eggs and peanut shells (kanji refers to both 'husk' and 'shell'). A strong image to lock in the kanji: imagine samurai using their mighty swords to de-husk corn and split peanuts! Also see 穀 (#984).","The samurai, now superfluous since the advent of the missile, was but a husk of a man. (Sumarai/Superfluous):Missile = Husk."
支,Picture sliding down the branch of a tree (in this case a pine tree or any tree with needles) and getting a bunch of needles stuck in your crotch--ouch!!,"A special branch of the military called the Needle Crotch Unit. Their only weapon is the needle embedded in their crotches, and they're quite adept at using them.","Sitting on the BRANCH of a coniferous tree, getting sharp needles in my crotch. (Remember there is no tree radical in this kanji, whereas 枝 (#713) (枝) does because a ""bough"" is a main part of the tree, whereas this kanji refers to a smaller branch. It can also be used to refer to the branch of a store (支店) which also has nothing to do with a tree)."
技,"(Adapted from darg_sama's) Balancing a branch on your finger is the prototypical example of a skill that is nothing more than a skill (i.e., it is completely useless).","I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of skill.",A surgeon's skill with his fingers determines his branch of medicine.
枝,The tree's primary branch is known as the bough.,"Differentiate between BOUGH and 支 (#768): 'branch' is smaller, and can also refer to the branch of a store (支店), which has nothing to do with a tree. But a BOUGH is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large boughs, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.",I think of a bough as a branch that's big enough to be a tree itself.
肢,"The limbs that this kanji represents are parts of the body that are connected to the trunk, like the main branches to a tree (“arms and legs” is the second meaning of this kanji). In other words, limbs are ""flesh branches"".",Limbs are body parts that branch off.,"No Timmy, we don't say ""flesh branches"", we say ""limbs""."
茎,"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Just get a flower and carefully wrap some toilet paper around its stalk. Spool also appears in 怪 (#773), 軽 (#774), 径 (#947), 経 (#1460).","PRIMITIVE: soiled crotch = soiled underwear.

It depends on how you look at it."
怪,"When you're suspicious, your state of mind twists round and round like a spool of thread.","Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reason: See my note at 茎 (#772).

Spool also appears in 茎 (#772), 軽 (#774), 径 (#947), 経 (#1460).",The girl's state of mind certainly became suspicious when she found a lot of used toilet paper in the waste basket beside her boyfriend's computer...
軽,"Fact: this kanji is used to denote a certain class of vehicles in Japan whose engines are under a certain size (less than 750cc I think) and are called light vehicles here. Imagine a so-called light vehicle or a light-truck with a load of spools driving down a road ever so lightly, careful not to let any of the spools roll out onto the street.","Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reason: See my note at 茎 (#772). Story: You are fussy about your car and to clean it you will only dab it very lightly with toilet paper. Spool also appears in 茎 (#772), 怪 (#773), 径 (#947), 経 (#1460).","I want to tread lightly on the environment.... That's why I CAR-SPOOL to work everyday.... I know, lame."

You knew that there was something different about him, but you joined his youth team and he watched over you carefully as 督 (#776) (督). It was uncomfortable, though, how your 叔 (#775) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...","Imagine one of those cliches of comedy: an uncle is above the little crotch of the new born nephew, when the baby pees in his face!","This kanji becomes easy if you use its proper meaning as a keyword: younger sibling of parent. Now read the character as a set of instructions to locate the younger siblings of your parents in your family tree, starting from yourself: If you go up to the row (generation) above, to your parents, then the younger siblings of your parents are the littler ones as that sprang from the same crotch."
督,Creepy uncle volunteers as gymnastics coach so he can eye the team from below.,"Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let's make one story: Your UNCLE was full of 寂 (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself.

寂,The unmarried uncle's house is the picture of lonlieness.,"Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let's make one story: Your UNCLE was full of 寂 (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself.

Remember before he started to hang out with his nephews, he lived all alone in a huge house, old and broken because of the loneliness."
淑,"Uncle (the one who is lonely and coaches kids in his spare time) is actually a graceful guy once he hits the water, as he used to be part of the swimming team in his youth.","Four straight kanji here with 叔 in it, so let's make one story: Your UNCLE was full of 寂 (#720) (寂), and he lived by himself.

It was uncomfortable, though, how your 叔 (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...",Your uncle’s bellyflop into the water is far from graceful.
反,"I think of an anti-hero (Dirty Harry etc.) for this primitive, whose trademark for disposing of villians is not an honorable fight, but a kick in the crotch and then a shove off a cliff (perhaps whilst the villain's back is turned).",Many cultures are so anti-sex you'd think they just want people to throw their crotches over a cliff.,"Despite their stunning similarity, this is not a 友 (#760), but the opposite: An anti-friend! Instead of always being at your side he throws you off a cliff."
坂,A slope is anti-flat soil.,"As the villain (pushed off by the anti-hero) is tumbling down the slope, he activates gadget skis to escape, spraying soil everywhere as he flies down the slope.","This kanji depicts a classic enviornmental problem: erosion. Erosion occurs when all of the soil washes of the side of the cliff, eventually causing the cliff to disappear, leaving a slope (an anti- cliff if you will) in its place."

When it comes into contact with money, the money disappears."
爪,A pictograph of Wolverine's adamantium claws.,"Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than claws. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his claws, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien's novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.",Pictograph of a vulture's CLAW. The CLAW DROPS and leaves a STREAM of blood. *Primitive = vulture.
妥,Overly gentle women are vultures who want to marry you and steal your money - not true but an easy mnemonic!,An eagle must be extra gentle to pick up a dainty woman in its sharp claws.,"Edward Scissorhands was very gentle, and adored by women in spite of his claws."
乳,"A fledgling is being nursed at a zoo, it is fed milk through a small tube that is bent in the shape of a hook (so that it fits inside its beak). The fledgling soon becomes addicted to milk, giving us this very catchy mnemonic: “fledgling hooked on milk”.",Drinking milk not only reduces 孔 (#100)'s but also strengthens nails (claws) thanks astgtciv.,This fledgling is hooked on MILK.. better than booze I suppose...
浮,Floating rubber ducky!!!,"A nest of fledglings somehow fell into the water (maybe it was perched on a tree bending over the river), but they are safe for now as the nest is floating.

But this one doesn't grow up into a swan - he's a vulture.
淫,"The vulture is on top of the porter and appears to be commiting a lewd act, so I throw water over the pair of them.","The PORTER is lewd like hell. If a female guest tries to enter the hotel, he throws himself on her like a VULTURE. Therefore it is highly recommended for the ladies to bring some cold WATER and pour it over him to cool him down.","The porter is dripping wet and has claw marks down his back. He receives a big tip for the unspeakably lewd acts he committed with a wealthy heiress guest, after she showed she expected more of him than just carrying her bags up to her suite."
将,"The leader in this race is the turtle! It appears he has covered the vulture’s feet in glue, so that the vulture cannot get off the starting block.",Once upon a time a turtle managed to trick a vulture into gluing itself to the turtle's shell. This way the turtle could now fly anywhere and became the leader of the turtles.,X-men and TMNT join forces: Their new leader is an awsome asshole.

奨,It's easy to picture a LEADER that uses a BIG dog to EXHORT his people to do more.,"Here we have a St.Bernard exhorting the vulture to become the leader in the race against the turtle, but he can't because of the glue. see 将 (#789).",Never support the leader!! Always exhort the underdog !!!

But of course, being vultures, they are always grabbing the dice away from each other.",The gigantic VULTURE swoops down and grabs that huge TREE!! AAAAH!!
採,"You pick cheries with your fingers, then along comes a giant vulture and picks up the whole tree with its claws.","Tip: vulture + tree : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called 采 (#791). Story: As you go to pick your nose, your parent grabs your finger and pulls it away (& gives you a lecture on social etiquette). REF: ""grab"" also appears in 菜 (#793), 彩 (#1850).",采 is grab (FRAME 采 (#791)) Pick is grab but delicately with your fingers only (thanks katsuo).

The teacher imparts his knowledge on the student, pointing the way and guiding with the finger.

""You best grab on ta'er with both hands and giv-er that VALVE some elba' greeze."" (I couldn't resist: this is a favourite Japanese word of mine, which also means ""regional dialect."" Such as Osaka-ben 大阪弁; almost all prefectures in Japan will boast of their own 弁 and slang).","You try to unblock an old rusty valve with a hit of the elbow, and then with your two hands, to no avail."
雄,Men walk with their elbows out from their sides in a weird turkey trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70's pimp walk.,Masculine duties are to offer your elbow to the lady by your left side and to cut the turkey on special meals.,"Surely you remember 雌 (#605)?

胎,"If any body part deserves to be put on a pedestal, it is the womb from which new life springs forth.","In this kanji pedestal carries a sense of base, or stand.

山,YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!,"Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a mountain often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji.

崎,"This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with mountain in place of soil. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives stone and strange.

鉛,Picture the molten lead (the heavy metal) being discreetly drained out of the factory into a gully behind.,"Lead is a very poisonous metal, and should not enter your mouth.",This is an odd story.

賞,You won first PRIZE in a shell-fish eating contest.

聖,"A holy man hears with his ears before he speaks with his mouth, which places him higher than a king in people's esteem.","The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口. However, this is easy because a true holy man uses his ear to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his mouth to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up.

慢,"I'll focus on the mandala primitive here. I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it's the ""man"" in mandara/mandala (曼荼羅).

Attempt to reconcile key words: in the romanticized manga version of the life of Nelson Mandela, a full-page drawing is devoted to the day he's set loose, depicting him kneeling by cool water, loose from the chains of bondage at last, drinking it in.

As it struggles for its life, it stirs up the sediment at the bottom, muddying the water such that your eyes cannot see through it."
環,"Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the ring”. First we have a jewel. Next we have the great eye of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many ceilings during their journey.

Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.","In conjunction with 還 (#900)....... When I tried to give her the jewel ring, she eyed me, threw it to the floor, opened her mouth and tried to speak, she said nothing.

The story continues in 鶏 (#2097).","The water from the mountain stream saved my husband from thirst, dehydration and the vultures."
規,"In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband's way of seeing things was considered the standard point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.","Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the standard model of a husband in American society.

鉄,Iron is a metal that gradually becomes lost due to oxidation and rust.,"Compare with 銑 (#288). In moving from pig-iron to iron, some of the metal's maleability is LOST. (The only difference between the two kanji is that IRON has knee-less, unbending legs, while PIG-IRON (270) has very supple, bendable legs.)","Iron, compared to 銑 (#288), has lost most of its carbon in the refining process. This makes it less brittle and a lot easier to use."
迭,"When you get lost, you just take an alternate road to get back on track.","When you lose your way, you can always try to tell the wife that you merely took an alternate road.

賢,An intelligent man is neither slave to his crotch nor to money. But an intelligent slave will know how to use his/her crotch to make money.,"Tip: The slave + crotch combination appears five times in Heisig. It may be worth making a new primitive.

仁,Mr. T shows his humanity by giving two bucks to every homeless person he sees.,Warning: This is not humanity as in all the people. But rather the qualities that make us human such as compassion and benevolence.,"This character, as Heisig points out, is strongly Confucian. Some scholars say that it references the importance of humane relationships between two people (parent/child, sibling/sibling, ruler/subject, etc).

賃,It's your own responsibility to pay the bus fare with the correct number of shells/money.,"In Japan they have automatic ticket gates so you cant easily cheat on your train fare.

The kanji is close to frame 1547 ""bag"", and although the later really refers to a ""straw sack"", I use the image of a sack of potatoes here, and that of a ""plastic bag"" for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book).","If you're super poor, you can substitute a potato sack for normal garments."

This kanji is lying.,"This is a very easy kanji. A PERSON who is PENT IN is obviously captured. DO NOT USE MR. T! Why people are using this as a primitive element is beyond me. MR.

But ... nothing happened because it was a McDonald's salad, chock full of preservatives and other garbage. The salad lived happily ever after (and so did the person who didn't eat it). The end.

Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.
渡,"This particular form of transit is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the water if it's not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 degrees.","Hint: This is most commonly used in わたる, meaning to cross (a river etc) - most of the other readings are fairly obscure. I guess Heisig didn't use that because of the earlier 'crossing' kanji, but there we go.

納,Have you heard about patients who have surgery and the doctor mistakenly leaves a medical instrument INSIDE the patient’s body and proceeds to stitch up the patient’s incisions with stitching THREAD? Can you say “malpractice SETTLEMENT”?　.,"Spider-Man was working as a surgeon's assistant. By accident, he threw his spider webs inside the patient, causing his death. Fortunately, the hospital reached an out-of-court settlement with the victim's family.",Another twist on the same theme: malpractise settlement for leaving a plastic spiderman inside patient.
紡,Spiderman can spin his webs in any direction.,"""You keep me spinning right round, baby right round, like a compass baby."" Spidey is making a retro 80s music video, spinning right round on his giant compass, singing his favourite song.","Spiderman is spinning around, shooting webs in every direction."
紛,"Spiderman got distracted when someone yelled, ""Spiderman, wait a minute."" He turned around and flew into a building. (""part"" also means ""minute"").","Due to the distractions of being a super-hero, spiderman can only work part-time. (variation on ayoung24's story).","Distract = to lose the thread of thought in part, i.e. not completely."
紹,Spiderman seduces all the girls he's introduced to.,"Peter Parker did a terrible job of seducing MJ. Spiderman however, seduced her as soon as they were first introduced.",The first thread of a seduction is an introduction.
経,The word ‘sutra’ literally means a rope or thread that holds things together. Here we see that it is a spool that is holding the threads together.,"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Spiderman (= thread) has a roll of toilet paper with the words of a sutra printed on each sheet (picture Spiderman saying the sutra as he tears sheets off the toilet roll). Spool also appears in 茎 (#715), 怪 (#716), 軽 (#717), 径 (#882).","Note: this kanji shows up a lot in economics-related words. In fact, 経済 (けいざい) is economics. I see it there a lot more than sutra-related words... Story: Spools of thread used to drive the economics of the day. Imagine an oxymoronic Buddhist sutra used to guide you through the world of thread finance."
紳,"Monkeys are very adept at swinging around trees. But when they met Spiderman, who could swing around even better than they could, they all quickly addressed him as sire.",Spiderman married a monkey and sired a brood of spider-monkeys.,"When conversing with a sire (noble person) you should always use proper words like ""speaketh"" and allow them to set the thread of the conversation."
約,"Anytime Spiderman breaks a promise, Aunt Mae hits him one over with her ladle.","Spiderman promised to get Aunt Mae's ladle back. He started to do a blood oath by spilling drops of blood but Aunt Mae stopped him and bound up the wound. ""It's only a ladle Peter"".","Thread + bound + drop of blood. Blood oath is a promise, where a drop of blood turns into a binding thread."
細,Dainty women would always rather work with thread than in a field.,"Spider-Man used to just be a dainty, brainy nerd.",Spider-Man's ideal type is a dainty girl with brains.
累,"(dingomick) Venom is upset because Spidey is just that much brainier than he is! He chooses to accumulate as many brains as he can, snatching them out of people's heads and storing them on top of his own, till there's just one massive brain on top of his head!","When you accumulate knowledge in your brain, neural pathways are constructed. All those pathways end up like a huge ball of thread tangled together. The more knowledge you accumulate the more threads you throw into the mix!!","Like a jellyfish, a floating BRAIN accumulates THREADS beneath it-- a weird collection."
索,"(modified akrodha's great story) VENOM has been captured by scientists and is being experimented on: they forced a CROWN of NEEDLES on his head and attached it to multiple electrical cords, which are connected to a big machine.","Spiderman has been captured and given the ultimate torture: they forced a crown of needles on his head and attached it to an electrical cord, which they are about to plug into an outlet...","An electrical cord has two (or three) prongs - needles - sticking out of it, a housing for the prongs that can be thought of as a crown, and the long thread-like wire leading to the appliance."
総,Spiderman could not achieve general acceptance by the media even after winning the public's heart.,"NOTE: This kanji stands for [Total, All, whole, gross]. The Kanji commonly used for ""In general"" will appear later as 般 (#2016).",To win GENERAL approval THREAD your way into the PUBLIC's HEART.
綿,"Spiderman's polyethylene suit starts to ride up after a while, so he always looks forward to the white cotton towels he wears while lounging around his apartment.",Cotton is the preferred thread for making white towels.,Spiderman has a dark secret - he has stolen all the white cotton towels from every hotel he has ever been in.
絹,Spider-man loves to run his mouth all over Mary Jane's silky flesh.,Spiderman has little squares in the flesh of his wrists that the silk webbing comes out of.,[silk] Silk is a thread that a larvae produces from its mouth to involve its body.
繰,"After stopping a bank heist, Spiderman is seen winding his webbing around the stolen goods to trap them in a tree until the police arrive to take them back.","Tip: goods + wood/tree : This combination appears 4 times. I suggest calling it ""furniture"" (a common type of wooden goods). REF: 燥 (#228) , 操 (#724), winding (FRAME 1369), 藻 (#2191). Story: You are winding up your new furniture using a thread to get it through the window of your high-rise apartment.","Spiderman often accidentally breaks his furniture (thanks Katsuo!) with his spider strength, so he is often seen winding up his webbing to drag a new piece up through his window."
継,Spider-Man is hooked on rice--it's all he inherited from his Uncle Ben. (thanks Nukemarine).,"A poor chinese fisherman could expect to inherit: the thread for his pole, a hook for catching something to eat, and some rice to live off of. (not concentrating on stroke order, sorry if that throws anyone off). (Adapted from bigloui,12-4-2006).","The INHERITANCE given to SPIDERMAN was only RICE, because it came from his ""Uncle Ben"", ha ha ha, get the HOOK? ""Uncle Ben"" RICE? To be fair, I couldn't work hook into that tale very well."
緑,Spiderman's nemesis the Green Goblin is in a slump; He's replaced his glider with a broom and is throwing grains of rice instead of bombs.,"Tie green thread around the broom that you use for sweeping up grains of rice (ie the kitchen broom) to distinguish it from the other colour threaded brooms that you might use in say the toilet, or the garage etc...",Hint : I think of the little broom used for preparing Japanese green tea.
縁,"There once was a lonely little pig that constantly followed Spiderman, always nuzzling his leg and oinking tenderly. Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the pig was to take a broom and sweep up all of Spiderman's leftover threads after having fought crime. The pig felt such affinity for Spiderman, he happily accepted—and did a good job too.",Spiderman has no affinity for a broom hence his house is a pig sty.,"I hate doing this, since the Simpson's Movie was recent. But think of the AFFINITY Homer had with the PIG that was to be killed. The AFFINITY first had SPIDER PIG (Spiderpig, spiderpig, does whatever a spiderpig does). Then Homer dressed the PIG up with a BROOM and glasses making him Harry PORKER. Homer had more AFFINITY for that PIG than his family, hence hilarity ensues."
網,"Spiderman traps The Rhino under the hood of his famous netting, where even Rhino's horns can not break free, in fact if the netting did not dissappear after a few hours then Rhino might even perish in there.",You use a 糸 to make a net shaped like a hood. A stray animal got caught in it by its horns and perished.,"Sadly, sometimes nettings have a thread so strong, the net gets caught like a hood on an animal's horns, and stays there until the poor thing perishes."
緊,"Whenever Venom is tense, he loses control of his sex drive and becomes a slave to his crotch.","TIP: This is the first kanji in ""kinbaku"" (緊縛), the art of Japanese rope bondage. STORY: The slave's crotch is tied up with rope (thread) to heighten the sado-erotic tension... 緊張[きんちょう].",You'd be tense too if you were a slave and your owner removed the threads covering your crotch.
紫,"Venom starts to choke on a spoon. He's about to get it out, when you manage to stop the spoon from getting out, so he turns purple, as he chokes, and dies.","Why is your ass purple? Well, I stopped and sat for a bit on a pile of thread... (I guess it was freshly dyed).","If you use Venom for the lower primitive, this kanji is a piece of cake. The upper primitive is the left part of 雌 (#605). So, PURPLE is the color of Agony, the female offspring of Venom http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hmOfolKlLFI/SN1l3LqagTI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/7tEpxy-Bfu0/s1600-h/agony.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agony_%28comics%29."
縛,"Spidey received good word that the acupuncturist working down the road was actually the evil Doctor Octopus! Spidey headed over to the clinic, and trussed the acupuncturist Doc Oc up using the maniac's own metal limbs!","Because people are so afraid of the procedure, string has to be used by the acunpunturist to truss up his victims, er, patients.","Ok, I already finished RtK, I'm coming back to warn you about this one - the right primitive is acupuncturist, not specialty. Trust me, mixing these up will mess you up later."
縄,"The tortoise has escaped! We tied it up with a straw rope, but all that's left of the rope are some torn threads, and the unbound tortoise is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not ""eels"". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in 滝 (#537) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as ""eels"". It is much better to call the right half of this character an ""unbound tortoise"".)","When Spiderman fights the giant tortoise, he grabs a straw rope from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the tortoise quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the tortoise).",Our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man takes off the straw rope that was binding the tortoise.
幼,"In its infancy, a butterfly is protected by a cocoon, as it doesn't yet have any power of its own.","During their infancy, children are often wrapped up tight like a cocoon (i.e. in those Snugli carriers) and supported by the muscle of their parents.",During INFANCY the moth in its COCOON gains its POWER.
後,"Column of walking legs (caterpillar) getting into a cocoon, about to leave its past self behind.","after a grub goes through the cocoon stage, it leaves its walking legs behind for a life of flight.",Think of a column of ants moving to a new nest. The soldiers are in front. The workers are behind carrying the cocoons on their long walking legs.
幽,The villagers haven't the faintest idea that giant coccoons resting in the mountain are soon to hatch.,"Hint: this is faint as in dim, weak or indistinct, not the verb.",Two people wrapped in their sleeping bags like cocoons are secluded in the mountains and can't hear the faintest sound.
幾,"At the Mexican fiesta, there is a coccoon eating competition. How many coccoons can one person eat? No one has managed more than two before giving up...","It is a little awkward when you are at a fiesta and the host serves some rare delicacy, like moth cocoons, the guests must decide how many it would be polite to eat. You do the math in your head and it comes out to two cocoons per person. This is why the horizontal line is a fraction bar with two cocoons on the top, and one person the bottom.",How many went to the party? Two aliens and one person (I feel sorry for that person).
機,An abacus is a mechanism made of wood used to calculate how many 'anythings'.,"To avoid confusing with 械 (#732), focus on the ""ism"" of mechanism. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish; mechanism here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable tree (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching abacus that smashes enemies between its giant beads.","[synewave]An abacus is a mechanism made of wood used to calculate how many 'anythings'. Important geek note: This is used as the counter for your remaining lives in video games, as it also means chance/opportunity."
畿,"People aside, I wonder how many rice fields there are in the capital suburbs.","This keyword refers to Japan's Kinki Region, a historic name for present-day Kansai. 近畿 きんき Just how many rice fields are in the capital suburbs? (The kinky (Kinki) people are hidden in the fields so you can't see them).",How many brains does it take to run the capital suburbs?
玄,What could be more mysterious than a cocoon in a top hat trying to sneak in...? (Pimitive: GANDALF).,The invisible man in his top hat and cocoon of white bandages is the most mysterious man in the world.,"As romanrozhok said, this kanji has little to do with mysterious. It has the meanings [dark, abstruse, calm] (in Spanish, [moreno and recóndito]). As for the story, the union of a hat and a coccoon is obviously a fakir turban. India was maybe an abstruse place far away from China. Visualize a mysterious, dark-skinned fakir with a turban (in calming meditation) and the kanji is yours!"
畜,"This mysterious rice field grows not only rice, but livestock too! Picture little pigs and chickens growing right out of the ground, among the rice plants. How bizarre!",The livestock are disappearing! I've placed Gandalf over the rice field to protect them.,Livestock has been mysteriously disappearing from the field. Aliens?
蓄,"One sneaky farmer wanted to amass a large collection of livestock. We all know that cows like to eat flowers, so he planted lines of flowers leading to his own fields. The livestock followed the lines, eating the flowers one by one, and amassed in his field.","To keep the difference between amass and 集 (#601) and 累 (#1464), I emphasize the MASS. To amass MASSIVE livestock, always feed them flowers. They'll get nice and plump. 蓄え = たくわえ = store; reserve; stock; savings.","It may seem illogical, but the fact is, you need to plant flowers if your aim is to amass livestock."
弦,"A magic bow that only Gandalf can yield: there is no bowstring on it, and he uses his magic to fire arrows.",A bow with a mysterious invisible bowstring.,"Small addition to cjon256's story to give me a more tangible image: A bow with a mysterious invisible bowstring that makes beautiful sounds like a stringed instrument. [Be careful when building your image; the ""sound"" primitive does not appear in this kanji.] 弦楽器 (げんがっき): stringed instruments 弦 (げん、つる): bowstring, string (of stringed instrument), chord (of a circle) 管弦楽団 (かんげんがくだん): orchestra 調弦 (ちょうげん): tuning."
擁,A mysterious turkey with human fingers wants to hug me... I will never go to Tokyo Disneyland again!,Imagine Gandalf hugging a turkey....ouch! It bit off his finger!,"Ok sweetheart, I want you to point your finger at the mysterious turkey who hugged you inappropriately."
滋,"Water is doubly mysterious. It's in all our nourishment...and yet, it's really not nourishing at all.","Going off the idea of the right side meaning rapid growth/increase of small objects, I've decided to make the right side be Gremlins, those little mysterious creatures that double rapidly. Gremlins find water a little too nourishing, as it makes them instantly multiply.",It’s doubly mysterious how water can be so nourishing—it doesn’t seem to have any substance and yet we would die without it.
慈,"Mercy is a doubly mysterious turn of the heart. On the one hand, everybody wants it, but on the other hardly anybody gives it.","Two gremlins are atop a victim, tearing out his heart while he begs for mercy.","Here we see the DOUBLE-MYSTERIOUS Siamese twins again, at the MERCY of the machines that pump blood through their veins, since the single HEART they share won't do the job..."
磁,A magnet is a rock with two sides; one that mysteriously pushes and one that pulls; doubly mysterious. (see astridtops' story).,"In the old days, people didn't know what magnets were.

系,"(Primitive: DNA, a drop of looong spiraled thread that is the key to your lineage).",Spiderman's lineage (who his family is etc...) can be found in his DNA in a drop of blood. The villain that gets blood of Spidey will be able to find out who is family and lineage is. be carfefull spidey...,A single drop of your blood holds the proof of the unbroken thread of your lineage.

遜,"My parents aren't at all modest about their grandchildren, at every opportunity they take them on the road showing them off to their friends!","He wasn't at all modest when telling us about his grandchildren - ""They're all on the road to success"" he said.","Swift wrote in ""A Modest Proposal"" that Ireland should solve its economic problems by collecting the nation's grandchildren from off the streets and eating them."
却,[instead; on the contrary; rather] Gone is the time for stamps - use e-mail instead.,We use e-mail now instead of regular mail. My e-mail is gone before you can even put a stamp on your snail mail.,If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That's why we use STAMPS instead.
脚,Shins are the part of the body that Japanese traditionally sit on instead of their asses.,"Shins are the part of the body that one uses instead of one's eyes, for finding furniture in the dark. (Ouch!)","This is one of the key aspects of soccer. At the beginning of every game you start by trying to kick the opponent's shins; their flesh, instead of the ball (lets them know you mean business)."
卸,Selling WHOLESALE HORSES over the internet had to be STOPPED because the cost of STAMPS was too much.,"If you need horseshoes (shoes that fit your horse's footprint), buy them at the wholesale shop. They lick and paste stamps in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.","Wholesale refers to the sale of goods in quantity to retailers for resale. When this kanji was invented, large loads of goods needed to be transported by horses who left steep footprints because of the weight they carried. The wholesale goods needed a special stamp to indicate that they were legal for resale. See 御 (#1500)."
御,An honorable man will not try to cut in front of the line at the wholesale stamp store. (Imagine just how much honor it takes facing those long lines at the post office!),"In front of the COLUMNS of the Capitol, the HONORABLE congressmen can be bought WHOLESALE.",When buying wholesale the honorable thing to do would be to wait in line like everyone else.
服,"It's customary to cover the flesh with clothing, but some designs are so outrageous they're not bigger than a stamp that just covers your crotch.",Modern clothing shows a lot of flesh -- some is practically no more than a postage stamp covering your crotch!,"The PART OF THE BODY that you must STAMP clothing on, no matter what, is your CROTCH!"
命,"When you're born, your fate is measured, fitted, and stamped onto your soul. Good luck defying it.","It is your fate to meet with a mouth, young postage stamp.",It is my fate/life to fit stamps together.

勇,"I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young man has to show his courage. They then receive a chopseal which is a mark of their courage.",A MA （マ） raises a man to have courage.,"Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the brain, and you receive the chop seal if you have the power to withstand it.

What a great story!"
通,"I bounce down the road on my pogo stick, easily getting through the dense traffic. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a chop-seal is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could utilize it as a pogo stick). [Edit: pogo stick also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530].",Building on gorgon's story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the traffic. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge chopseal that they utilize to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the road.,Lots of Ma (マ)s utilize the road to take their kids to school. Sure makes a lot of traffic.
踊,Dancing with pogo sticks tied to your legs is more like jumping about.,"The high jumper has his wooden leg fitted with a pogo stick, and can now jump even higher. (See my note at 通 (#1511) for pogo stick). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword ""jump"" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256's post), ""Dancing"" would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from 舞 (#1912)). New Story: I was no good at dancing due to my wooden leg... until I had it fitted with a pogo stick!","This is totally wrong. It doesn't mean ""jump"", it means ""dance""! 踊 踊 (#1512) and 曜 躍 (#1379) are homonyms, so it is easy to become permanently confused about which one DOES NOT mean ""jump/leap"". Caveat Lector! Note: 舞 舞 (#1912) is quite a bit rarer (and not a homonym)."

留,"Got a receipt for that dagger, son? If not, we're going to detain you and send you to work in the rice fields.",The use of RANSOM NOTE (think of a receipt with a dagger through it on a door) works great with DETAIN.

Isn't that a fair trade?,The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to TRADE the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.

Note: this is simplified to 旧 in the Joyo characters. Ex: 児=兒児 (#62), 稲=稻稲 (#976), but not in 潟潟 (#2195) because it is a traditional place name (Niigata). In non-Joyo, the characters are written both ways: 焔焔 (#2605) is often written 焰. ... Note2: Stroke order varies since it is not Joyo.",I went pictograph with this one: a cracked white rice grain--one that has been bashed in a mortar.
毀,"Wow, that baker must really be mad! He's trying to BREAK his MORTAR by throwing it to the SOIL. Whoa! Now he's aiming a MISSILE at it!","Drawing inspiration from 撃 (#766) by kinkypete, this kanji shows the rules for a bizarre form of janken (paper, stone, scissors). A mortar can break soil (grinding it to dust). Soil can break a missile (burying it - causing it to eventually rust away). And a missile can break a mortar.",You'll break everything down to dirt if you use both mortars and missiles.
興,"To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be entertained. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the same: staples. What tools!

Bartending isn't just about bottles of whiskey, it's about ladling out advice.",Old fashioned bartending had the server ladle out the alcohol from a giant whiskey bottle.
酎,"While the keyword is ""hooch"", this usually means 焼酎. It has similar effect as whiskey and sniffing glue has: you get intoxicated.","Tastes like whiskey, smells like glue?

酵,The secrets of fermentation are passed to the son who displays the most filial piety.,"Since filial piety is all about respecting ones elders, and the older a whiskey bottle is (i.e. the time it have spent undergoing fermentation) the more respect you should give it, the meaning of this kanji becomes clear.

酷,It's cruel to pour alcohol down a cow's mouth.,Offering whiskey to people to encourage them to make revelations is cruel.,"There is a saying that a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts.

酢,Drinking alcohol that's turned to vinegar feels like a saw going down your throat.,"I spent ages sawing that whiskey bottle open, but when I got in, it had all turned to vinegar!","For those who like real kanji history: I went to a vinegar shop and the owner said that the kanji for vinegar is derived from 酒 and 作 where you simply take the right side of each, because to make vinegar you actually have to use sake. So here we have vinegar, which is 酒 we 作 into 酢."
酔,God you're drunk! How many whiskeys did you have? 9? 10?,Whiskey with 90 percent alcohol will get you drunk. I don't care who you are.,"As Ernest Hemingway said, it only takes one drink to get me drunk. But I'm not sure if it is the ninth or tenth drink that does it. [from dingomick]."
配,To DISTRIBUTE WHISKY during Prohibition you had to be as sneaky as a SNAKE.,"In Japan, it's rude to distribute the sake to your self before anybody else.","Those who have studied physics may find this useful. The two parts of the kanji represent the two statistical distributions for bosons and fermions. The Bose-Einstein distribution is represented by the sign of the bird because birds, like bosons, are social creatures who like to flock together. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is represented by a snake, since snakes, like fermions, are solitary creatures who like to keep to themselves."
酸,The prostitute carries an old whiskey bottle filled with acid to throw at any difficult Johns.,"Dealing alcohol requires a license, dealing acid requires fast legs (to run from the police).","I stopped doing acid, and am living the clean life. Well, aside from all the whiskey and prostitutes."

鼓,"I really hate the primitive meaning of ""table"" for ""bean."" I just use ""bean."" Anyways, for the DRUM primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a DRUM with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: ""DRUMing on a DRUM with a huge BRANCH"".",Mr. Bean tries to play drums with 10 different branches he found on the ground.,"These SAMURAI, sitting at the TABLE and waiting for their food, grab some BRANCHES to begin DRUMMING a rhythm while they wait. (In fact, they stand on the table, removing the top stroke!)"
喜,"The samurai sitting on the drum is on a stage, and the people below him are rejoicing with their mouths in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.",Rejoice with the sound of drums and voice!,Ten beans in my mouth! I was starving so this small meal is enough for me to rejoice!

盆,The part of the kitchen sink in which you wash dishes in is the basin.,Your mom yells at you to stop throwing dishes in the basin. She lifts up (to show primitive order) the broken parts to show you the damage you've done.,"I'm not an expert, but it seems that as a basin this refers more to an oceanic basin that a kitchen one, and in any case seems most common in reference to the famous O-Bon festival. So, a story: in the O-Bon festival, so many dishes are broken that all the parts have to be thrown into a deep oceanic basin."
盟,(re: Raichu) An undercover alliance between Japan (the sun on its flag) and Turkey (the moon on its flag) detected by a surveillance satellite dish. http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html.,"A new alliance is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their alliance they clean up together one dish, and present it to the photographers.

The warlord, who wanted to propose to form an alliance to another warlord, would send him a big ceremonial dish with the sun drawn in the center.

藍,Indigo flowers have to be overseen because they are often picked for their beauty.,"Traditionally, 青 青 (#1654) could be used to describe blue OR green.

Instead, he seals himself in a box, makes sure there are enough postage stamps on the outside, and mails himself. He's a good man at heart , you see... just a bit of a slave to his libido.

In a drowning nightmare, I forced lucidity and allowed myself ascend to the surface.","The keyword refers to limpid water, but also to something that is clear (as in ""crystal clear""). In Buddhism the thinking mind is often compared to a pond : if you stir the water, the mud from the bottom mixes with the water, and the mind is ""muddy"".

僚,Trivia: The right primitive is kagaribi - 尞 - fuel used for sacrifices. I would use sacred bonfire as a primitive .

Here, my colleague is Mr T and he set up a little pup tent for his minidog, then turns around and completes his TPS reports.","A colleague implies someone that you share work with, such as in your company or profession, etc. Here your colleague helps you to erect your pup tent during a company outing. Note: Heisig's warning to keep this distinct from other similiar kanji such as 朋 (#19), 友 (#760), 伴 (#1287) and 輩 (#1765). That is why I chose to have the person element pictured as someone (the colleague in this case) helping with the work of building the pup tent."
瞭,I paint a huge eye on the side of my pup tent. Why? – It’s obvious: when I’m at the camping site it makes it obvious which tent is mine so I can quickly locate it.,"Users of Kanji Koohii, please open your eyes!

Wow! What a sacred bonfire!,"All-male dormitories in Japan are really weird, and tend to have a little too much 男気.

There is a different kanji for that meaning (腫れる). This kanji means swell as in, a tire swelling/expanding, your income swelling/expanding, dough swelling/expanding, etc. Johnskb's story is best b/c it does not involve swelling in the sense of inflammation, just general expansion of the stomach.

参,"I'm going to visit my grandpa in the hospital. He broke his elbow, and it became really big and contorted into a weird shape. I hope he will be all right!","Hint: This is the humble/old kanji of the verb ""to go/to come"", and also is the kanji for ""three"" on legal documents. I suggest using the ""three musketeers"" for this primitive, raising their three blades with the elbow.

REF: rare (FRAME 1723) , 診 (#1860), 疹 (#2624), 謬 (#2752).",It's rare to see the king carrying his own parasol - typically he gets one of his attendants to do it for him (thanks to Katsuo for umbrella + shape = parasol and to Peppi for the story idea).

斉,The Scotsman goalkeeper adjusted himself. He reached down and adjusted the two things between his skinny fencepost legs.,"HINT: this kanji as a primitive can mean goalkeeper.

舞,The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem dances nakes for him.,I learned 無 (#1913) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive dancers should dance wearing nothing but sunglasses.,"Heisig, let's get this straight: NEW keywords: 躍 JUMP ex-躍 (#1379); 踊 DANCE=ODORI ex-踊 (#1512); 舞 KABUKI ex-舞 (#1912) (used in concepts related to dance, like stages, fluttering, etc.). So, KABUKI 歌舞伎【かぶき】is the keyword here. STORY: We learn 無 (#1913) first because it is a very common kanji. Then we go to see KABUKI en the EVENING wearing SUNGLASSES."

租,The EU and US impose such high tariffs on food imports that third world wheat (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket shelves.,"According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe.

狙,"When her home was invaded by a pack of dogs, the little girl climbed on the shelf and aimed various items at the dogs below.","There's this game at the carnival where you aim at prizes on a shelf.

並,"This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of two people standing in a row.","Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a rowing boat. In a rowing boat people sit in rows, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for ""rowboat"" coming at frame 1876. The rowing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for ""rowboat"" has a generic meaning of ""a small boat"". In any case, the kanji for ""rowboat"" will not appear as a primitive in the book.",Roman numeral II with 2 rows of animal horns.
普,People at Universal Studios wait in rows so long that the sun goes down.,"To me, row is way too close to 列 (#875), so I'm adopting Fab's meaning of rowboat from the previous frame.

The wife slaps the husband so hard with her fingers that the entire boat flips upside-down.
僕,"Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig method, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it's the kanji for ""boku."" Males usually use either ""boku"" or ""ore"" (instead of ""watashi"") to refer themselves. ""Boku"" is slightly boyish and soft; ""ore"" is rough & tough.

Of course, you have to be Japanese and accept humbly their food.","""ACCEPT HUMBLY"" is a translation for 頂戴する (chōdai-suru), a Japanese expression of THANKS-GIVING that shows an UNCOMMON degree of respect and formality, and is reserved for the most UNCOMMONly solemn occasions. Ironically, 戴 also appears in 戴きます (いただきます), which is also a form of THANKS-GIVING, but is anything but UNCOMMON. In fact, it is so commonplace to that it borders on formulaic and meaningless. (NB: いただきます is also written 頂きます)."
洪,Water plus Noah's Ark equals deluge.,Lots of water coming together is called a deluge.,"Even as the water was rising, somehow Noah got together all the right animals before the deluge began in earnest."
港,"During a deluge, all the poor snakes get washed into the harbour.","All throughout the deluge Noah had been kicking himself for forgetting to bring any snakes onto the Ark.

恭,"Noah feels like he gets no respect from the other passengers on the Ark, but they all make him Valentine's Day cards to show how much they respect what he's done for them.",If you wanna stay together you have to show your valentine respect.,"As I like Aretha Franklin's song ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"", I cut out each of the letters from pieces of card, then string them all together and send it to her as a valentine."
選,There were so many snakes on the road to Noah's ark so they had to elect which two would represent the snake species.,"You're driving on the road and you see two snakes together. You can't avoid both, so you have to elect which one gets run over.",Isn't this how the US presedential election works? You are given a choice between two snakes. Their politics are actually strung together but you get to feel as though you chose which one you want to lead you down the political road for the next four years. So which snake are you going to elect?
殿,Mr. President! We all stand here together under a national flag. One thing is certain: we'll never give in. We are launching nuclear missiles now to implement mutually assured destruction protocol.,"(+synewave) Noah looks on in disbelief as Mr. and Mrs. Smith board the Ark, start waving their flag everywhere and blasting everything in sight with a missile launcher.",This is the Mr. (との) used when addressing someone at the start of a letter.

He drops it, and it falls down & down until it looks like nothing more than a DROP, landing at the bottom of the well!",I drop a domburi down into the well for the goblin living there.,"A donburi is rice bowl, with drops of food (other than rice) and garnish on top. The steep-sided shape of the typical donburi bowl is depicted in the kanji as a well, which is not a bad comparison. Picture: http://www.sushigallery.net/Arts/chicken%20donburi.jpg."
囲,The village surrounded the well with a wall so kids wouldn't fall in.,"Tweaking dingomick's story: The village well is pent in by a surrounding wall so that kids don't fall in. 囲む (かこむ): to surround, encircle 範囲 (はんい): range, extent, scope 周囲 (しゅうい): surroundings, environs, periphery, perimeter, circumference 囲う (かこう): to enclose, fence in 囲い (かこい): enclosure, fenced in area (such as a corral or a pen) Careful: 郭 (#1985).",You get good surround sound when your pent-up in well.

Just imagine someone shoving a piece of sushi into their mouths with chopsticks.",China (中) taken two times should be about the total landmass of Asia.,"In the Roman Empire there were signs marking where you were about to enter Asia. This was a dangerous place for Romans, so the sign consisted of a picture of two Romans (= Roman two) being eaten by a mouth."
悪,"Because Asian people started to eat Western food, their hearts became bad and they started having heart attacks.",Much of the Asian food in America is bad for your heart - just imagine some sodium & MSG laden Chinese takeout.,"This kanji really means ""Evil"" which is quite different from ""bad."" STORY: This kanji was really created by westerners, not ASIAN people. It's a form of propaganda, which says all ASIAN people have EVIL HEARTS. (made up story)."
円,The shape of a Yen coin.,"A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge glass hood with his cane (using it as a lever), to get to just one yen coin.

The circles are the coins which are passed back and forth for deposits and withdrawls.
角,"A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an angle.","[+nuke] As a primitive, a boomerang. This boomerang is used to grab a bunch of meat, or flesh, lying around on the ground at a farm. First, you throw it straight at a walking stick, then it makes a right angle and goes to walking stick number two, and wraps around that. A quick tug, and you've got all the flesh flying toward you contained in that triangle.

触,"For insects to get in contact with each other, they need to place their antennae at just the right angle.","Wow, he threw that BOOMERANG with such skill, it made CONTACT with that INSECT in mid flight.","This is commonly read as 触る （さわる）, meaning to touch or feel something.

解,"Did you know that you can unravel a cow? If you stick the dagger in at exactly the correct angle, the whole cow will just unravel.",Unravel the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.,"I tossed the BOOMERANG, which stuck like a DAGGER into a COW that I targeted. Now I watched the COW's insides begin to UNRAVEL from the cut."
再,The king has eaten too much and has to get a new belt again. See his fat rolls hanging over?,"(I thought this was easier to remember as king with a belt) As the king gets fatter, his belt needs to be adjusted again and again.","This is a belt with a non-adjustable jeweled buckle.

So they put one of those white funnels around my neck to correct my posture.
溝,A gutter funnels water.,A gutter takes the water that falls as rain and funnels it off to where it can be dealt with appropriately.,"Instead of a normal gutter, the city is cutting costs by just putting a huge celery funnel on the side of the road every few hundred yards. While this is actually a bit more efficient than standard gutters and quite cheap, it'sa bit dangerous (as there's a rather nasty juicing mechanism attached to the bottom of each one). Imagine telling some kids to stay out of the gutter on a rainy day, and one of them not heeding you (kids love splashing in them!) and falling to her doom."
論,"Right part: academic conference (a meeting, some of the attendees making notes in scrapbooks during presentation). Argument at academic conferences is naturally carried out using words.",It's very difficult to present a good argument if you don't bring along a scrapbook with some key words jotted down to the meeting.,"Words must he chosen methodically to make a good argument.

I sort of imagine a TED conference with cavemen discussing the wheel with a 2001 Space Oddesy-esc transition to Henry Ford also at a TED conference. (www.ted.com A seriously good website)."
偏,Mr. T is very partial to hentai comic books. I know because he dropped a pile of them when I accidentally bumped into him at the door to kinokuniya!,"Mr. T is partial to konbini hentai. He reads them for hours every day after work at his local konbini. (Primitive: KONBINI HENTAI, all the magazines(scrapbooks) by every konbini door in Japan).","Comic book is a nice idea.

No wonder he keeps his face hidden...in shame!"
冊,Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.,Pictograph of three books tied up for transport.,"A pictograph of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy viewed end on: All 3 tomes held together with one ribbon - ""one ribbon to bind them all""."
柵,"A palisade is a ""fence of stakes especially for defense,"" usually the stakes are very strong, set closely together, and pointed on top. Tome can be seen as a pictograph of several close-set wooden stakes, braced by one horizontal bar.","Before I build him a wooden palisade, the mighty leader gives me a mighty tome on the subject.","I'll let the tome primitive refer to a spell book, in order to keep it distinct. In that case, this kanji shows me a wooden palisade under siege by a few mages, trying to demolish it with their spells from the spell book."
典,"This kanji means a code of law, not a secret language or symbolic language (such as programming code) ... Story: The code of law is a tool used to bend citizens to society's will. You can use the image of a totalitarian state, but be careful not to confuse it with the pinnacle primitive 阪 (#1294).","Think ""codex"" (mnemonic help) or ""code of laws"", or even Leonardo Da Vinci's code.

Peter Parker hands in his paper with the name Peter Spiderman--wrong family name. Oops!
婚,Marriage is the day in this woman's life where she gets a new family name.,Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji 昏 昏 (#2526). Story: Never enter into marriage with a woman at dusk (wait until you see them in daylight). Note: This is an ancient proverb . . . (probably).,"3 Kanji related with marriage, all the 3 with the primitive WOMAN. 嫁 嫁 (#581): Since the man is hardly ever home, the woman feels more like she's married into the HOUSE . 姻 姻 (#627): is the state you get after the marriage, in which the woman has got you PENT IN like a DOG, so that you cannot go after other bitches. 婚 婚 (#1972): is ""THE"" day in this woman's life where she gets a new FAMILY NAME.

民,All the people of the world with all their family names shouting with their big mouths.,"Once they'd learned to properly utilize their mouths to form a language, the people of the world all adopted family names, regardless of their race, culture etc..","Note: Vox populi means ""voice of the people"" referring to people as nation. This is often used as an abbreviation of the phrase ""Vox populi, vox dei"" which means ""voice of the people, voice of god"", referring to the godlike power people have over their government.

蒸,"This kanji is used in compounds for the steaming of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist, steaming food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be completely soaked in water, and then poured over a thin piece of flooring under which there is an oven fire.",Note: complete + water + floor are later combined into 丞 丞 (#2927). Story: The driver of a steam train asks you for a helping hand and explains that your job is to throw flowers on the fire to make the steam.,(EASY KANJI!) At the top we see hot steam forming FLOWERS. At the bottom we see the STOVE FIRE heating the bottom of a pan. So what's in the middle causing all this steam? Its all COMPLETELY WATER.
承,To get someone to completely acquiesce it takes 3 dunks in the water before they give.,"To get someone to acquiesce, duck them completely in aqua (=water) three times.

Then: The expedition to the poles is bad for your health, and the decay that started in your mouth spreads to your crotch – at which point you fall to the floor.","(modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using 朽 (#1331). You travel to the poles, a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is decayed (see story for 朽 (#1331)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your mouth as your lips turn blue, then your crotch also gets cold as your body fails; finally you fall to the floor.","Santa Claus (from the North Pole, of course), has a wooden sled led by reindeer snared at the mouth.

牙,The kanji looks like an elephant with tusks. the box is the elephant's eye.

So: In it's Kanji form, it has four (4) strokes, in it's primitive form (I suggest: ivory because that's what elephant tusks are made of) it has always five (5) strokes for all Kanji in RTK1."
芽,Zoo keepers are baffled as to why the tips of the elephant's tusks keep budding into flowers.,Buds while they're still small tend to be tusk-shaped.,"An elephant places a big flower on the other elephant's tusks, to show they're best buds."

雅,"""Goodness gracious! Such an elegant turkey with a tusk."" This mnemonic is meant to join RtK's keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used ""elegant"" here, which is not confounded so easily with 淑 (#778), and accurately represents the character's meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary).","To not confuse it with 恩 (#652) or 淑 (#778), think of the phrase ""Goodness gracious.""

They roll the dice to decide in what order they have to keep watch and when everyones turn is.","I find ""turn"" alone is too generic to remember, so I add an additional keyword, numerical order. This is perhaps the most common context in which this kanji is found, e.g. 1st, 2nd = 一番、二番. Story: I see animal tracks leading to the rice field and start to worry, but then see the numerical order in which the tracks are made: 一番mouse tracks, 二番　cat tracks, 三番　dog tracks, then 四番　lion tracks.

倭,Mr. T was selected to head up the committee studying the Yamato period.,"This kanji was originally used as the Chinese word for Japan, and its etymological meaning is that of a ""supplicating people"". In the 8th century the use of this kanji to describe Japan (read as ""Wa"" or ""Yamato"") was changed to the kanji for 和 (#963), which was popular because the Japanese liked to believe that their society was based on harmony (not on being submissive and dominable as this kanji suggests). Story: Dad joined the Yamato committee to foster international cooperation.",There's always a person named Yamato on every committee. And I always hate them.
侠,"Mr T approaches the knights and stabs his scissors into the table they're seated at. ""I pity the fool who questions my chivalry!""","Mr. T believes in chivalry - so whenever he plays a game of rock, paper, scissors, he always throws scissors to let the other person win. Note that this has nothing to do with women at all (hence the absence of women in this kanji) - just with everybody being weaker than Mr T.","Chivalry demands equal weapons in a duel. So if a person challenges you with scissors, you'll have to duel him with your own pair."
倦,Mr. T invented the book because he was fed up with scrolls.,"Mr T has been chasing some fools for a while, but they keep leaving riddle scrolls behind, making Mr T use his noggin to try and catch them. ""Mr T is fed up with these fool games!""",Mr T is fed up because the scroll he is trying to read keeps scrolling up just as he starts.

佃,"Not so long ago, if Mr T was working in a field, he would have been a slave.","The first television show that Mr T ever worked on was a slavery period drama. Operating on the assumption that all black people look alike, the director decided to save on his budget by just hiring one black person. In each scene requiring slaves in the background to work a field, he would put Mr T in the rice paddy in the background. Then when they changed the scene, he would simply put Mr T there too - no changing clothes, no CG - just the same dude in the background of EVERY scene.",A person in a field is working a field.
仔,"Remember that sordid 件 (#959) when Mr. T was caught having relations with a cow? Well, some months later the heifer drops off the child at T's place. Does Mr. T share responsibility for his animal offspring?","Quite frankly, more than any person's child, I have always found animal offsprings (like puppies (仔犬/こいぬ）, and kittens (仔猫/こねこ)） far, far, faaar cuter.","Mr T, the vet, is helping the mare give birth. Except, animal offspring doesn't but out. A child does instead! Ewww, someone in the villiage has been behaving badly."
仇,"Mr. T uses a baseball bat for hitting foes. ""I pity the foe! I mean fool!""",Mr. T can handle nine foes all by himself!,In this kanji we see Mr. T surrounded by nine foes.

Being severely disappointed, mr T decided to prostitute her and make a profit instead.","Mr. T is able to make a profit off of varoius things: merchandise, slogans, muscles, etc. ""I pity the foo who can't make a profit"", Mr. T says to his love doll.","Money corrupts, and Mr T is no exception.

侭,Mr. T is exhausted! As is the woman who just gave him shakuhachi.,"You see person holding the exhaust pipe which has just dropped off their new car, and say, ""You should return that and get your money back!"". ""Trouble is,"" they reply, ""I bought it as is"".","Mr T buys a used car as is and gets a great deal. As soon as he gets it off the lot, though, the exhaust freezes and falls off. He stops the car and yells out the window - ""Hey, fool, you better give me a refund!"" ""No, "" says the salesman, ""you bought that as is!"". Mr T calmly steps out of the car, picks up the exhaust, walks over to the salesman, and wraps the exhaust pipe around his neck (causing his neck to freeze from the cold). I pity the fool that runs an as is scam."
脩,"Once again, Mr. T ventured out into the remote area to visit his old taskmaster (see 悠 (#958)). However, the old taskmaster has become very weak. His flesh looks like dried meat and his heart almost stopped (no heart). He stayed a whole month to take care about his former teacher.","束脩 脩 (#2130) シュウ, おさむ ...

倅,"""My son"", sniffs Mr. T, ""I'm so glad that you are now a college graduate"" he said.","Important note: Instead of the keyword ""my son,"" the keyword ""good for nothing son"" may be more appropriate. This word is one of the examples of depreciating titles for family members. This word is used to refer to your son when you especially want to lower his status. So, keep that in mind when deciding on a story or when making your own. I suggest CountPacula's story, since it involves that ""good for nothing son"" meaning a little more.",I won't consider that person to be my son until he actually manages to show he's capable of something and graduates!
做,"Note that the meaning of this (rare) kanji is ""make (something) / do (something)"", not ""get by with"". Story: Mr. T doesn't rely on happenstance, he makes things do what he wants. Edit: In fact three Japanese kanji dictionaries I checked all list 做 as an alternative to 作 作 (#1224), so ""make (alt)"" might be the best keyword. Story: Mr. T by happenstance found an alternative way to make things. (See also bennyb & faneca's notes).","(food for thought) I know this is RTK3 and all, but this kanji seems almost completely useless. The two most common phrases it's included in are 言い做す to speak as though something were actually the case and 見なす to regard (as equivalent). Both of which USUALLY just write なすin kana, and neither of which have anything to do with the meaning. In fact I can't find any trace of Katsuo's suggestion of this meaning. Anyone care to enlighten me? Perhaps this one's worth skipping.","@bennyb: As much as I usually love katsuo's contributions, I agree with you this time. For the sense you mention, I guess ""figuratively"" would be a better keyword. See [1]: 「見做す」""to regard [figuratively] as"", 「思い做しか」""imagination (to think [figuratively])"", etc. On the other hand, look at the Chinese compounds at [2]: it clearly means ""make""/""do"" (做爱 to make love, 做梦 to dream).

冴,"(Note that per Heisig, this doesn't mean 'able to cut'; it means mentally sharp, adept, or 'on your toes'!)

凋,"You don't want the lettuce to wilt, do you?

凛,"Much more stately than that soil podium, this is made of ice. You can still see the dude standing behind it in his top hat, and he still spouts pretty much nonsense as many times as he can, but you have to admit his showy altar is quite stately.","This stately home in Brittain has been used for winter weddings many times. A reverend in a top hat stands behind the altar in the home's chapel, which is adorned with ice sculptures.

鳳,"Souring in the winds there is only one bird left. The phoenix. It scorched the other birds, never to return...","(The extra stroke combines with white in the bird component to make a hundred-year-old bird) The Phoenix -- the bird made famous in myth, that after it reaches hundreds of years of age, is reborn and rises again on the wind.","The famed Ho-oh rides the wind above all other birds. 鳳 appears to refer to the male bird, while 凰 refers to the female, presumably one whose beauty is coveted by emperors. (The generic word Ho-oh is the compound 鳳凰. Note that technically this is not the Phoenix but shares some similarities.)"

剃,The younger brother wants to look cool and shaves himself with a saber instead of a razor.,"My little brother kept asking me to teach him to shave. I got a little tired of his requests so I told him to try it himself using a sabre. Long story short, he won't be annoying me anymore.","Your younger brother wants to shave too, so he takes his toy saber since you won't give him a razor."
厭,"The poor chihuahua who had fallen down a cliff was totally despondent about his position. He saw the sun and the moon pass by, but expected no rescue any more.","While you may know the story of Hachikou, this is about a chihuahua that lost its master. They used to play a game - Sun and Moon - where the master would stand at the top of a cliff and wave his hands as if to resemble sunrays, and the dog would lie on the ground in a crescent shape - then they would switch. But one day the master fell! The dog, for years after, would go to the spot where he fell at sun and moon rise and look despondent. Imagine the despondent puppydog eyes.","Under a cliff, the sun beating on its flesh, our chihuahua is despondent realizing there's no Taco Bell around here."
雁,"Mr T is sent on a mission to find a wild goose that swallowed some important, top-secret chemicals (they were in a baggie, so he has to find it before it dissolves!). After searching for clues and tracks, he finds it - and backs it up against a cliff.

He then looks at it - wait - this isn't the wild goose, this is a mere turkey! Sent on a wild goose chase!","I've been sent to chase the wild goose!

囁,If someone's whispering you'd need three ears close to his mouth to be able to hear it.,"It's funny how if I just talk, no one listens, but if I whisper, many ears are eager to hear what's coming from my mouth.","People are curious beasts. If you whisper something out of your mouth, there will be many ears listening. Or alternatively, think in terms of power levels: In kanjis, the same element can appear in groups of 1-3. Here we see mouth power level dropped to the minimum (whisper), which means that ear power level has to be raised to the maximum. (like mobile phones, which need more power when the bars indicating signal strength drop)."
喋,Two good friends looking at their childhood tree house and remembering how it seemed like generations ago since they were up in it chattering away all night.,Mouths like to chatter about the new generation on the tree.,"The only thing that comes out of the MOUTHS of this GENERATION of young people, is chatter and chatter.

喰,Ingest is a fancy word for what you do with your mouth as you eat.,"Note: This is a colloquial word for ""eat"", so the formal keyword ""ingest"" might better be replaced with something like ""scoff"" or ""tuck in"", etc. Suggested story: ""Yeuk! I can see the food rolling around in your mouth when you scoff it like that!""","Ingest implies something that goes in your mouth and you swallow it, not necessarily something you deliberately eat. If you stick your head out the window of a car and ingest a fly, it's not the same as deliberately eating a fly at the dinner table. [Note: what Katsuo says is true; this kanji means OM NOM NOM NOM.

坦,I'm usually flat on the soil passed out at nightbreak.,"I have a nice big garden with one problem – moles!

嬰,The woman removes the two shells covering her breasts (for modesty) and then attaches the suckling infant. How very Little Mermaid...,I see this as two suckling infants clamped onto their mother (woman) like shellfish when breastfeeding.,The old form of 桜 (#2082) uses this as the right hand side (i.e. two shellfish instead of owl).
